---RESPONSIBILITIES---
- Ecosystem Partner Activation
Independently build and manage Unichain’s core partner stack—wallets, RPCs, bridges, indexers, and dev tools. Develop partnership tracks tailored to specific use cases (ie. token issuance, LP onboarding, cross-chain swaps) to reduce friction and enable composability across key DeFi primitives. Support UVN’s launch.
Impact: unlocks access, usability, and product readiness for core DeFi flows
- Liquidity Migration & Onramping
Own and execute Labs' liquidity-focused adoption push—starting with Q2 LP onboarding and activation. Design and manage liquidity migration strategies (e.g., LP tooling, partner zaps, migration funnels) and lead coordination with key market makers. Develop strategies for driving inflows from key ecosystems (ie. Base, Arbitrum, eth mainnet).
Impact: Increases TVL, swap volume, and LP activity on Unichain
- Token Issuance & Asset Growth (V4)
Build and scale onboarding motion for token factories, TGEs, and pre-launch partners. Help projects launch natively on Unichain by coordinating liquidity seeding, partner listings (wallets, FOR), and ongoing support for hook-driven token models.
Impact: drive net new liquidity
- Builder Recruitment & App Activation
Lead targeted outreach and support for early-stage native protocol teams and mature cross-chain apps. Prioritize verticals that align with sequencer fee generation and volume growth (ie. swaps, stablecoins, cross-chain messaging).
Impact: grows transaction activity and sequencer revenue via increased app footprint
- Cross-Ecosystem Liquidity & Interop
Design systems and partnerships, in conjunction with BD & research, that improve liquidity routing and interoperability (ie. Superchain routing, filler alignment, stablecoin pools). Push Unichain toward becoming the liquidity backbone for trading across chains.
Impact: position Unichain as the most effective DeFi execution layer in the Superchain ecosystem
- Partner Alignment
Strategize how Uniswap Labs products can act as force multiplier for ecosystem building efforts from Uniswap Foundation, Optimism Foundation, Flashbots and other key foundation partners on all Unichain adoption programs. Drive shared meetings, sync on ecosystem activation, and ensure partners are effectively executing on necessary commitments.
