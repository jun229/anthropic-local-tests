# A Letter from Hayden Adams 

Uniswap Labs is unique because of our people. Ours is a performance-driven and collaborative culture. We hold ourselves to high standards and are passionate about the role we play in shaping web3 through infrastructure and products. Our goals are ambitious, and our leaders are empowered to build lean teams where each person has an opportunity to make a significant impact. Our team members are multifaceted, with plenty of interests outside work, as writers, parents, musicians, athletes, artists and more. We believe this is an important part of building a culture of creativity, which manifests through the novel products we deliver to the world. 

# At-Will Employment {#at-will-employment}

Employment with Uniswap Labs is “at-will”. This means that employment may be terminated at any time by the employee or Uniswap Labs with or without cause, and with or without advance notice. The at-will relationship includes the right to hire, transfer, promote, reclassify, layoff, discipline, terminate or change any term or condition of employment (except for at-will employment itself) at any time with or without cause or advance notice. Our policy of “at will” employment cannot be changed except by a formal written agreement specifically entered into for this purpose signed by a member of the executive team.  

Neither this employee handbook, nor any policy or practice of Uniswap Labs, is intended to imply continued or guaranteed employment, or otherwise limit in any way the policy of at-will employment. In describing Uniswap Labs’ policies and procedures, this handbook does not obligate Uniswap Labs to follow any particular procedure in the course of imposing discipline or terminating employment.

Our goal is to have the best team possible, and this means having the best people possible. Your experience with Uniswap Labs should be mutually beneficial; of course we want to grow our Uniswap Labs, and we also want to foster the growth and development of all our team members. If we’re not holding up our end of the bargain, make sure to let us know.

# Vision, Mission and Values

Our Vision  
We envision a world where everyone exchanges value through fair, accessible markets on the internet. In this new economy, value is global, within reach, and flows to creators and contributors. Uniswap Labs builds foundational products and infrastructure to bring this vision to life. 

Our Mission  
Unlock universal ownership and exchange. 

## **Uniswap Principles | Uni-code**

*Our Uniswap operating principles (Unicode) articulate who we are (our values) and how we work. They are our daily guideposts for how we interact with each other, our users, and our community.*

**People First**

We believe easy, safe, fair value transfer on the internet can improve people’s lives. Access, security and experience is the center of everything we do. By pursuing decentralization, interoperability, and durability we align with our users over the long-term, and win. Internally, people are our greatest asset, and we strive for an environment where everyone can make an incredible impact. We share direct, kind feedback so we can improve. When we advocate for an idea, a technical tradeoff, or a business goal, we start with why — why it’s better for our user, our company.

**Simple**

Our craft is keeping it simple. In a complex field, we create clarity & simplicity. We write and build in human terms, understood by everyone. This shows up in the design and language of our user experience, across our code, and in how we speak to the world and each other. We are deliberate in the words and images we use.

**Pink**

We love pink, conceptually and irl. Disrupting the status quo is fun. We hold each other accountable to do serious work – without taking ourselves too seriously. We love unicorns, and we bring whimsy into our experiments and our day-to-day.  The people-first, internet-native financial system we’re building welcomes anyone.

**Push Through Ambiguity Together**

Startup life can be ambiguous — and especially at the frontier. We are at peace with the uncertainty. We push through resistance. We show up ready to explore new ideas. We have conviction that our mission is worth it. When things get hard, we stay on the same team. We create scalable solutions to make things less ambiguous in pursuit of our mission. We don’t assume shared knowledge or beliefs across our team or our users, and we seek to understand others’ “why.” When we don’t agree with something, we assume positive intent & default to trust.

**Build to last, iterate fast**

We see through the clouds of today into what’s possible tomorrow. We don’t fall prey to short-term thinking or get distracted by narratives and prices. We aim to move fast, learn from our mistakes, and we ship when it’s right. Where our opinions bring safety, simplicity, and new choices in the best interest of our users, we express them. This long-term view is a big part of why we are a beloved brand. We must protect it.

## Code of Ethics {#code-of-ethics}

Uniswap Labs’ Code of Ethics is one of the ways we put our UNIcode values into practice. We empower all team members to have their own personal standards and make decisions that impact our reputation. However, individual actions at work shape Uniswap Labs’ internal environment and external reputation, which is why it is important to take responsibility to act with respect, honesty, cooperation and fairness in all situations. Whenever you’re faced with a decision, always do what you know is ethically right, and, of course, always follow the law.

We expect that team members will not knowingly misrepresent Uniswap Labs and will not speak on behalf of Uniswap Labs unless specifically authorized. The confidentiality of proprietary information, and confidential or commercially-sensitive information (i.e. business strategies, business initiatives, business relationships or business, legal or financial affairs etc.) which we haven’t released to the public or is not generally known about Uniswap Labs, or that of our customers or partners (i.e., “trade secret”), is to be treated with discretion and only disseminated on a need-to-know basis.

We strive to improve the quality of our services, products, and operations and will maintain a reputation for honesty, fairness, respect, responsibility, integrity, trust, and sound business judgment.

Violation of the Code of Ethics can result in discipline, up to and including termination of employment. The degree of discipline imposed may be influenced by the existence of voluntary disclosure of any ethical violation and whether or not the violator cooperated in any subsequent investigation.

As a condition of employment, all team members are required to sign and abide by the *Universal Navigation Inc. Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement (CIIAA)*, including the confidentiality/nondisclosure provisions of that agreement.

## Devices and Communications {#devices-and-communications}

Uniswap Labs Supplied Devices  
Uniswap Labs supplies all team members with a laptop. You should receive your laptop before or on your first day. You will be able to access all work related platforms such as email, internal apps/webs, Intranet, Slack, Zoom and other relevant platforms. All of our devices are equipped with Mobile Device Management (MDM).

Treatment of Laptops  
Notify the IT team if your laptop becomes damaged or isn’t working properly. They will work with you to get it fixed or replaced.

As your laptop is Uniswap property, at the time of offboarding, you will need to return your laptop. Instructions will be provided to you on how to do so at the time of offboarding.

Treatment of Laptops: Returning your laptop

Electronic Communications  
All information created, sent, received, or stored on Uniswap Labs’ electronic resources is Uniswap Labs property (this includes computer, email, instant messaging, company issued cell phones and voicemails, fax, Intranets, and the Web  \- even when accessed from personal devices) and should be used for job-related purposes during working time and at all other times. Such information is not the private property of any employee and team members should have no expectation of privacy in the use or contents of Uniswap Labs' electronic resources. Passwords do not confer any right of privacy upon any employee of Uniswap Labs. Team members should understand that Uniswap Labs may monitor the usage of its electronic resources and may access, review, and disclose information stored on its electronic resources, including messages, personal email communications sent and received on the employer's computers but using private email accounts, and other data, at any time, with or without advance notice to the user or the user's consent. In order to ensure that the usage of such electronics remains ethical and lawful, team members must abide by the following guidelines:

* Uniswap Labs-issued laptops are only for work purposes to protect the security of Company information and your own privacy, in the event that Uniswap Labs needs to pull or monitor information on your work laptop.

* To avoid phishing or malware emails, do not open e-mail messages from unknown senders or advertisers; rather, delete the emails or contact the People and Operations teams.

* To prevent computer viruses from being transmitted through the system, team members are not authorized to download any software from the internet onto their computer or any drive in that computer unless authorized.

* Use of portable drives to download Uniswap Labs information for any purpose other than Uniswap Labs business is prohibited without the advance written approval by the Uniswap Labs’ management. 

* To protect against interception of Uniswap Labs’s Confidential Information, please make sure that appropriate safeguards are used (e.g., encryption) for sensitive information.

* Do not use Uniswap Labs’ systems in a manner that could infringe on or violate the copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret or other proprietary rights of third parties. You should not knowingly use or distribute any such material downloaded from the internet or received by email without the prior written permission of the Legal team. If you have any questions, speak to your Manager or a member of the legal team.

* Uniswap Labs assumes no liability for loss, damage, disclosure, or misuse of any non-Uniswap Labs data or communications transmitted or stored on the Uniswap Labs's electronic resources. 

*  Team members may not, without authorization, transmit, retrieve, or store confidential Uniswap Labs information on their personal email systems. Unless otherwise allowed by law, confidential Uniswap Labs information, whether in electronic or hardcopy form, may only be accessed and used by team members as required to perform job duties.

* You may not bypass, turn off or disable any antivirus protection software that Uniswap Labs provides or make unauthorized changes to system configurations installed on Uniswap Labs Systems.

* You may not sign on to any Uniswap Labs System using the password or user name of another employee. Sharing such account passwords is strictly prohibited.

Slack Policy  
At Uniswap Labs we use Slack as an internal messaging and collaboration tool. You will receive training on how to use it during your first week.

 Guidelines:

*  If you create a channel, you are responsible for defining the purpose and expectations of what should be shared in the channel. Post this information in the channel.  
* To support an inclusive work environment, please include your preferred pronouns on your profile. (e.g. “John Doe \-(they/them))  
* Be mindful of the channels’ member list before you start messaging. Keep conversations in both public and private channels work-appropriate.  
* Take Slack conversations to email, phone, or face-to-face when required.  
* Reserve @here, @channel, or @\[name\] for important or urgent matters only.  
*  Update statuses accordingly and regularly, especially when away or OOO.  
* Acknowledge receipt of messages and requests, even if you can’t focus on the message or request until later.  
*  Avoid sending multiple messages when you don’t get an immediate response. Colleagues may be in meetings or doing “deep work”.  
* Be smart with your messages and share context and complete thoughts. For example, don’t send a direct message that just says “hi” to avoid unnecessary notifications and use threads to organize discussions.  
* When an employee receives outreach from a third-party regarding Governance, the employee should assume the outreach is in their capacity as an employee and share information about the outreach internally on the \#governance slack and note how the employee plans to respond to the outreach or to coordinate a response with others internally regarding the outreach, or on the \#privileged-legal-sensitive, if there is a question about how these policies apply to a response.

Google Meet (video) Policy  
At Uniswap Labs we use Google Meet to have video calls. 

 Guidelines:

* Google Meet is the preferred communication medium for meetings – even if meeting in person, please make sure there’s a Google Meet link in the invite as some people may be unexpectedly remote.  
* Ensure your camera and microphone are working before the start of each meeting. Turn your camera on unless it’s not possible. This helps build engagement among colleagues and facilitates communication.  
* In your display name, you may include your preferred pronouns.  
* Mute your microphone when you are not an active participant to minimize background noise.  
* Be mindful of the background visible in your Meets meeting. Limit distractions. While some distractions are unavoidable, try to limit distractions by turning off Slack notifications, putting your phone down etc.  
* Avoid multitasking. You were invited to the meeting for a reason.

## Social Media Guidelines  {#social-media-guidelines}

It is important to us that we maintain healthy relationships not just internally, but also externally with the Uniswap Labs community. One of our favorite ways to engage is through our social media platforms, and we have some guidance for how best to do that outlined below. 

Uniswap Labs’ Official Accounts  
We have official Uniswap Labs accounts on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/FCfyBSbCU5), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Uniswap), and [Github](https://github.com/Uniswap), all of which are easily found through our [website](https://uniswap.org/). Familiarize yourself with the Uniswap Labs brand and audiences; it is a great way to build relationships with consumers. We encourage you to follow  us on any and all of these platforms to stay up to date & informed. 

Personal Social Media Accounts  
Should you choose to engage in social media via your personal accounts, please use your best judgment when deciding what to post. Remember that an employee of Uniswap Labs, can be interpreted as representing the company. If you have something you want to post about the markets, your experience at work in the general sense, your thoughts on crypto, might be interpreted as coming by the Uniswap Labs team, please run it by the communications team before posting.

Guidelines:

* We expect that all Uniswap Labs team members will protect proprietary, confidential and copyrighted information, as well as refrain from posting derogatory content.  
* Avoid using your social accounts to pump your bags – shilling tokens or projects for your own gain doesn’t represent you or Uniswap Labs in an ethical or reputable way. If you are using applications that distribute tokens and are tied to Twitter or other social accounts, we encourage you to not include any affiliation to Uniswap.   
* Be a crypto and web3 community evangelist \- avoid spreading FUD or being a price puppeteer.   
* Feel free to show your creativity or rep a favorite artist by using NFTs for your profile image.  
* Consider the images and personal life details you share \- drug usage, drug paraphernalia, discriminatory or hate speech, disrespectful statements and/or other similar content will be on the internet and follow you forever, and will be interpreted by some as a representation of the UL brand in a negative light. Some posts could also violate this policy so be smart about what you share.

Potential clients and partners will want to get to know the organization and sometimes even team members; always present your best and true self. We will not continuously monitor your personal accounts, however all content you post should be done responsibly. We reserve the right to discipline team members in accordance with our policies for any content posted that is deemed inappropriate. 

When talking about the Protocol, you **must** follow these guidelines (on Social Media and/or informal settings):

* Feel free to discuss the protocol generally: what it is, how it works, how it originated, what makes it unique, how it is better than any other protocol or AMM or the legacy financial system, etc.

* Feel free to discuss the vibrant community, many integrations, and varied ecosystem contributions related to the Uniswap protocol. 

Ways you **should not** talk about the Uniswap protocol, Uniswap Labs, or the UNI token (on Social Media and/or informal settings):

* Do not use “Uniswap” as a stand alone term or shorthand wherever possible. Always refer to “Uniswap Labs”, the “Uniswap team”, the “Uniswap protocol”, “Uniswap interface”, etc.  

* Do not use “we” to refer to the protocol (e.g., don’t say “we do 1B in daily volume”). If you are talking about the team or the interface, use “Uniswap Labs” or “Uniswap interface”. If you mean the protocol, say “Uniswap protocol”. 

* Do not highlight the ability to do a token sale through the Uniswap protocol.

* Do not mention the price of anything ever, expressly or implicitly. 

  * **Do not mention the UNI token price ever**\--not even implicit references to increases (e.g., don’t tweet “What an amazing day\!” after UNI has a big jump). 

  * If you’re ever asked about UNI, you can say Uniswap Labs does not speculate on the future price of UNI.

  * Do not talk about the price of other tokens. The exception here is you can talk about the price of Bitcoin, ETH, or the very general token market (“bull” or “bear” etc.), as long as you’re not using one of them as a proxy for UNI (e.g., don’t say “UNI is the biggest app on Ethereum and ETH is up today…”).

  * You can talk about the price of Unisocks. Just don’t suggest it might go up from the current price.

* Do not encourage people to buy and sell cryptocurrency (e.g., “hodl\!” “buy the dip\!”).

  * Avoid anything that could look like investment advice.

* Generally do not publicly engage in conversations regarding the protocol fee switch that may accrue to UNI tokens.

  * Do not say anything that might imply the price of UNI may go up, that we want it to go up, or are happy when it goes up. 

* Do not suggest that anyone should expect an airdrop. 

* Do not encourage anyone’s expectations that people should rely on Uniswap Labs’s efforts to make the protocol succeed and especially not to make the UNI token valuable. Highlight community efforts so people don’t incorrectly get the impression that they should rely on us exclusively to drive any value to the UNI token.

* Generally try not to reference competitors such as Pancakeswap or Sushiswap because it’s free publicity for them.

## Travel and Event Safety {#travel-and-event-safety}

## Uniswap Labs takes reasonable measures to protect the physical safety of employees. We comply with safety standards in our New York office and will take reasonable measures to protect employees when we host events outside of our office. 

## That said, Uniswap Labs employees may participate in travel or other third-party events such as conferences, activities, and social gatherings that take place outside of our office. Such events are beyond the control of the company. Even though you may be with other employees or attending such an event in part because of your employment, you accept that you are responsible for yourself in locations and situations outside of the Uniswap Labs office. 

## Please make sure you take appropriate precautions when participating in these kinds of travel and events and making related arrangements (e.g., transportation), especially when you’re in any places that have had a history of safety concerns.

## 

## Employment Classifications

It is important for you to have a structural understanding of Uniswap Labs in order to facilitate communication, workflow, and quality standards, as well as for you to understand your employment status and benefits eligibility. 

Full-time team members are team members who work Uniswap Labs’ normal, full-time schedule on a regular basis (30 hours or more). Full-time team members are eligible for all benefits, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefit program.                                                                 

Part-time team members are those regularly scheduled to work fewer than 30 hours per week and at least 20 hours per week. Part-time team members are not eligible for employee benefits, but may receive Uniswap Labs perks on an as-needed basis.

**Fixed term** team members work for Uniswap Labs for a defined period of time to work on specific projects or tasks. These team members are eligible for our healthcare benefits if they are working full time hours.

Temporary or Special-team members are hired for a specific period of employment (such as for a temporary replacement for an employee on a leave of absence or an internship), or for a special project. These temporary team members do not receive any of Uniswap Labs’ benefits, other than those required to be provided by applicable law.

Non-Employee Categories: Independent contractors, consultants, and agency service providers are not Uniswap Labs team members and are not eligible for any Uniswap Labs-sponsored employment benefits. You are an agency service provider if you perform services for Uniswap Labs through an independent contract service or agency, whether as a leased employee, contractor, temporary or similar designation.

Exempt: This term refers to those team members whose duties and responsibilities make them exempt from overtime compensation requirements, as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). If an Employee is classified as exempt, they do not receive compensation for overtime worked. If you have a question regarding whether you are exempt or nonexempt, contact your Manager for clarification.

Non-Exempt \- Overtime: By law, non-exempt team members may be compensated by equivalent time off for extra hours worked, provided the hours are scheduled and taken within the same pay period in which the work occurs. Overtime may not be worked without a Manager’s approval. Non-Exempt team members are required to report all hours worked in a timekeeping system established by Uniswap Labs’ timekeeping system. When overtime is paid, the Employee’s wage rate increases to 1.5 times the normal hourly rate after 40 hours have been worked in a work week (defined as Sunday through Saturday). Additional overtime requirements may apply in certain states outside of New York (see below for California).

Team members who fail to obtain approval prior to working overtime should still record all overtime worked. Team members will be paid for all work performed. However, continually working unauthorized overtime in violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action.

California team members

In California, nonexempt employees will be paid overtime as follows:

* Compensation for hours in excess of 40 for the workweek, or in excess of eight and not more than 12 for the workday, and for the first eight hours on the seventh consecutive day of work in one workweek, shall be paid at a rate one and one-half times the employee’s regular rate of pay; and  
* Compensation for hours in excess of 12 in one workday and in excess of eight on the seventh consecutive workday in a workweek shall be paid at double the employee’s regular rate of pay.

## Zero Tolerance Harassment and Discrimination Policy  {#zero-tolerance-harassment-and-discrimination-policy}

Uniswap Labs is proud to be an equal opportunity employer (EEO). We provide employment opportunities without regard to age, race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, disability (including gender dysphoria and similar gender-related conditions), sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation (including actual or perceived heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, and asexuality), veteran status, military status, domestic violence victim status, reproductive health decision making or any other protected category\*.  Both Uniswap Labs and the law prohibit unlawful employment discrimination. Unlawful discrimination occurs when an employer makes employment decisions, including hiring, promotion, raises, termination, and other terms and conditions of employment, based on the protected class of an applicant or employee, and not on merit. 

In New York State and/or New York City, Protected Categories include traits historically associated with race (including but not limited to hair texture and protective hairstyles), creed, ancestry, alienage, familial or marital status, partnership status, caregiver status, gender, gender expression, the employee’s or the employee’s dependent’s reproductive health decision making (including but not limited to a decision to use or access a particular drug, device or medical service), status as a victim of domestic violence, sex offenses or stalking, engaging in certain lawful off-duty and off-site legally protected recreational activities, and, in certain circumstances, unemployment status, credit history, salary history and arrest and conviction history.  All such discrimination is unlawful and against Uniswap Labs policy.  This policy applies to all aspects of employment, including, but not limited to, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, and termination, and it covers all individuals providing services in the workplace, including team members, interns, consultants, independent contractors, subcontractors, vendors and others providing services pursuant to a contract in the workplace (or team members of such persons).

\**classification protected by applicable state, federal, or local laws*     
Zero Tolerance Harassment Policy  
Both Uniswap Labs and the law also prohibit unlawful workplace harassment. Unlawful harassment is any conduct that creates an intimidating, offensive, or abusive working environment or subjects an individual to inferior terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. Harassment on the basis of any other protected class is also strictly prohibited. Prohibited harassment can take many forms, including, but not limited to, the following:

* Making or using derogatory comments, emails, letters, epithets, slurs, or explicit jokes.  
* Derogatory posters, photographs, cartoons, drawings, websites, emails, text messages, or gestures.  
* Touching, assaulting, impeding, or blocking normal movements.

This policy applies to all individuals providing services in the workplace and prohibits unlawful discrimination or harassment of or by team members, interns, consultants, independent contractors, subcontractors, vendors and others providing services pursuant to a contract in the workplace (or team members of such persons). In addition to this Policy, team members will be required to complete Harassment Prevention training on an annual basis.

Sexual harassment is a specific type of harassment involving either unwelcome sexual advances, or visual, verbal, or physical conduct based on sex, gender, pregnancy, or related stereotypes. Sexually harassing conduct can be between persons of the same or different genders.   
Sexual harassment also includes harassment that is not sexual in nature (for example, offensive remarks about an individual's sex or gender), as well as any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any other conduct of a sexual nature, when any of the following is true:

* Submission to or rejection of the advance, request, or conduct is:  made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment; or used as a basis for employment decisions.  
* The advances, requests, or conduct have the purpose or effect of substantially or unreasonably interfering with an employee's work performance by creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment, even if the complaining individual is not the intended target of the harassment.

Examples of prohibited conduct include:

* Verbal Sexual Harassment: Sexual innuendo, comments reflecting sex- or gender-based stereotypes, sexually suggestive comments, jokes of a sexual nature, sexual advances or propositions, offers of employment benefits in exchange for sexual favors, threatened or actual reprisals after a negative response to sexual advances, or graphic commentaries about a person’s body.  
* Written Sexual Harassment: Leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive objects or pictures, cartoons or posters, suggestive or insulting sounds, suggestive or obscene notes or letters or any social media platforms (both personal and work related).  
* Physical Sexual Harassment: Physical contact of a sexual nature, including sexually suggestive or offensive touching, impeding, or blocking movements, fondling, kissing, massaging, or brushing up against the body.  
* Online (for example, derogatory jokes or statements or sexually suggestive postings in any social media platform including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, etc.).

This list is illustrative only, and not exhaustive. Uniswap Labs prohibits all forms of sexual and discriminatory harassment at the workplace and at employer-sponsored events.

Where and When Harassment Can Occur  
Harassment can occur not only at the workplace but at client meetings, business conferences, while traveling for business or at employer-sponsored parties and events.  Calls, texts, emails and social media usage by team members can constitute unlawful workplace harassment, even if they occur away from the workplace premises, on personal devices or during non-work hours.  

Complaint Procedure  
If you have been subjected to or witness any behavior that may constitute sexual or other harassment, discrimination or any other violation of this policy, you are encouraged to promptly speak to, write, email, or otherwise contact your Manager, a member of the People Operations team, or any other member of senior management with whom you feel comfortable.    
	  
Complaints or reports may be made verbally or in writing.  To submit a written complaint, individuals are encouraged to use the [Complaint Form](#harassment-complaint-form), which is available at the end of this Handbook.  Individuals who are reporting a complaint on behalf of other individuals should use the Complaint Form and note that it is on another person’s behalf.  The complaint should be as detailed as possible, including the names of all individuals involved and any witnesses. 

The effectiveness of Uniswap Labs’ efforts depends largely on individuals telling us about inappropriate workplace conduct.  If individuals feel that they or someone else may have been subjected to conduct that violates this policy, it should be reported immediately.  If individuals do not report sexually harassing or other harassing conduct, Uniswap Labs may not become aware of a possible violation of this policy and may not be able to take appropriate corrective action.  

Investigation by Uniswap Labs  
Uniswap Labs takes all complaints of sexual and other discriminatory harassment seriously and will promptly and thoroughly investigate the facts and circumstances of all complaints, whether the complaint was made verbally or in writing.  Any employee may be required to cooperate as needed in an investigation of suspected sexual or other harassment. 

While the investigation process may vary from case to case, Uniswap Labs’ investigation may involve one or more of the following:  interviewing the complaining party and the individual about whom the complaint was made;  taking any interim actions as appropriate;  obtaining, reviewing and preserving relevant documents, including electronic communications; interviewing any relevant witnesses;  and documenting the investigation. Uniswap Labs will promptly notify the complaining party and the individual about whom the complaint was made of the completion of the investigation and, as appropriate, of the final determination. Uniswap Labs will take prompt corrective action as appropriate to eliminate sexual and other harassment, including disciplinary measures up to and including termination of employment.

All persons involved, including complainants, witnesses, and alleged harassers, will be accorded due process to protect their rights to a fair and impartial investigation.  The investigation will be kept confidential to the greatest extent possible, consistent with conducting a thorough and fair investigation.  

Alternative Reporting and Remedies   
Uniswap Labs encourages individuals to report incidents of harassment and any other violation of this policy internally. However, individuals who believe they have been subjected to sexual or other harassment or discrimination in the workplace also may seek relief by:   
 

* Filing a "Charge of Discrimination" with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for violation of federal anti-discrimination laws, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII).  You can contact the EEOC by calling 1-800-669-4000 (TTY: 1-800-669-6820), visiting their website at [http://www.eeoc.gov](http://www.eeoc.gov), or by email at info@eeoc.gov.  
    
* Team members working in New York State may file a complaint alleging violation of the New York State Human Rights Law, either with the New York State Division of Human Rights (NYSDHR) or in New York State Supreme Court. NYSDHR's main office contact information is:  NYS Division of Human Rights, One Fordham Plaza, Fourth Floor, Bronx, New York 10458\. You can also call (718) 741-8400 or visit: [http://www.dhr.ny.gov](http://www.dhr.ny.gov).   
    
* Team members working in New York City may file complaints alleging violation of the New York City Human Rights Law with the New York City Commission on Human Rights (NYCCHR) or in New York State Supreme Court.  NYCCHR’s main office contact information is:  Law Enforcement Bureau of the NYC Commission on Human Rights, 40 Rector Street, 10th Floor, New York, New York; you can also call 311 or (212) 306-7450 or visit [www.nyc.gov/html/cchr/html/home/home.shtml](http://www.nyc.gov/html/cchr/html/home/home.shtml).


Other states and local jurisdictions may have additional protections against sexual and other harassment and discrimination.  team members can contact the state, county, city or town in which they live to find out if such a law exists.  

Under the applicable employment discrimination laws, there are different deadlines for filing complaints with the different government agencies and courts.  If unlawful harassment is found to have occurred, government agencies and courts may be able to provide various remedies, such as requiring an employer to take appropriate action to stop the harassment and awarding monetary damages and attorney’s fees.

No Retaliation  
Retaliation against or harassment of individuals who oppose any unlawful practice under the employment discrimination laws, in good faith file complaints, or truthfully assist or participate in an investigation or proceeding involving sexual or other harassment or discrimination, is unlawful and prohibited by Uniswap Labs.  No one will be subject to any form of discipline, reprisal, intimidation, harassment or retaliation for good faith reporting or complaints of incidents of harassment, discrimination or any other violation of this policy or the law, or for pursuing any harassment or discrimination claim, assisting another individual to report harassment or discrimination, or testifying or cooperating in related investigations or other proceedings.  Any such retaliation or harassment should be reported, and team members found to be engaging in such unlawful conduct will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

Responsibilities of Managers  
All managers who receive a complaint or information about suspected sexual or other discriminatory harassment, observe what may be harassing behavior, or for any reason suspect that there may be harassment or any other violation of this policy, are required to report such suspected harassment or violation to a member of the People team.

In addition to being subject to discipline if they engaged in sexually harassing conduct or other harassing conduct themselves, managers will be subject to discipline for failing to report suspected sexual harassment or other discriminatory harassment, or otherwise knowingly allowing sexual harassment or other harassment to continue.

Managers will also be subject to discipline for engaging in any retaliation.

## General Anti-Retaliation Policy

Uniswap Labs prohibits any retaliatory action, including threats of adverse action, against an employee, former employee or individual independent contractors because such individual does any of the following:

1) discloses, or threatens to disclose, to a Manager or to a public body any activity, policy or practice of Uniswap Labs that the employee reasonably believes is a violation of law, rule or regulation or which the employee reasonably believes poses a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, *provided,* that with respect to a disclosure to a public body that the employee has made a good faith effort to notify Uniswap Labs bringing the activity, policy or practice to the attention of a Manager and has afforded Uniswap Labs a reasonable opportunity to correct such activity, policy or practice, unless (a) there is an imminent and serious danger to public health or safety, (b) such activity, policy or practice could reasonably be expected to lead to endangering the welfare of a minor, or (c) the employee reasonably believes that reporting to the Manager would result in destruction of evidence or other concealment of the activity, policy or practice or physical harm to the employee or any other person, or (d) the employee reasonably believes that the Manager is already aware of the activity, policy or practice and will not correct such activity, policy or practice

2) provides information to, or testifies before, any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any such activity, policy or practice of Uniswap Labs; or

3) objects to, or refuses to participate in, any such activity, policy or practice of Uniswap Labs.

For purposes of this policy, “individual independent contractors” are natural persons engaged by Uniswap Labs as independent contractors who are not themselves employers, and “retaliatory action” includes actions or threats to take such actions that would adversely impact a former team members’ current or future employment or threatening to contact or contacting U.S. immigration authorities or otherwise reporting or threatening to report the suspected citizenship or immigration status of the employee or the employee’s family or household member to a government agency.

## Notice of Rights and Remedies Under New York Labor Law Section 203-E (New York State)

Under New York Labor Law Section 203-E, Uniswap Labs shall not access an employee’s personal information regarding the employee’s or the employee’s dependent’s reproductive health decision making, including but not limited to, the decision to use or access a particular drug, device or medical service without the employee’s prior informed affirmative written consent.  Uniswap Labs will not (a) discriminate or take any retaliatory personnel action against an employee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of or on the basis of the employee's or dependent's reproductive health decision making, including, but not limited to, a decision to use or access a particular drug, device or medical service; or  (b) require an employee to sign a waiver or other document which purports to deny an employee the right to make their own reproductive health care decisions, including use of a particular drug, device, or medical service.

An employee covered by this law may bring a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction for a violation of New York Labor Law Section 203-E, and a court may award damages, afford injunctive relief, order reinstatement, and/or award liquidated damages.

## Reasonable Accommodations:  Disability, Nursing Mothers and Religious  {#reasonable-accommodations:-disability,-nursing-mothers-and-religious}

Reasonable Accommodation for Disabilities, Pregnancy, Religious Observances and Needs Related to Domestic Violence, Sex Offenses or Stalking  
Uniswap Labs is committed to accommodating any and all of our qualified team members with a disability. We comply with the *Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)*, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, and all other state and local fair employment practices and laws. As an Equal Opportunity employer, it is important to us that our team members feel valued and supported. Therefore, it is our policy not to discriminate against any qualified individual with disabilities in any process (application, hiring, compensation, training, etc.). We also provide reasonable accommodations to our team members related to pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions. 

Uniswap Labs will engage in an interactive process with an applicant or employee to identify and explore possible reasonable accommodations for the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of the job, unless undue hardship would result. We may require medical certification of both the disability and the need for accommodation.  Keep in mind that Uniswap Labs can only seek to accommodate the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified disabled individual. Therefore, it is your responsibility to come forward if you are in need of an accommodation.  

Uniswap Labs will also engage in an interactive process, as outlined below, to explore and provide reasonable accommodations for other needs that would allow the employee to perform the essential functions of the job without creating an undue hardship for Uniswap Labs, including for needs related to the following:

* Pregnancy, childbirth or a related medical condition, which may include bathroom breaks, breaks to facilitate increased water intake, periodic rest (for team members who stand for prolonged periods), and/or an unpaid leave of absence.


* Domestic violence, sex offenses or stalking, a leave to seek medical attention or psychological counseling for the employee or the employee’s child; obtain services from a domestic violence shelter, program or rape crisis center; participate in safety planning, including relocation; or attend to legal matters.


* A sincerely held religious belief, practice or observance, which may include adjustments to work schedules or modifications to certain workplace policies.  

If you would like to make an accommodation request, please ask your manager or your People Business Partner. The application process is voluntary and confidential, and any information disclosed to us regarding your disability will not be disclosed without your permission, except when necessary to accommodate your disability or when required by law/legal process. 

Accommodations for Nursing Mothers   
Uniswap Labs will provide a reasonable amount of unpaid break time to accommodate a female employee's need to express breast milk for the employee's nursing child, in accordance with applicable law, including New York Labor Law 206-c.  For team members working at Uniswap Labs’ physical offices, we will also provide the employee with the use of a reasonably comfortable, private, and sanitary room or other location in reasonably close proximity to the employee's work area, for this purpose.  Discrimination, harassment and retaliation against an employee who chooses to express breast milk in the workplace is strictly prohibited. team members should notify their manager if they are requesting break time under this policy. If you need accommodations for offsites please talk to your People Business Partner and we will work with you to get you what you need.

New York State/New York City Law

Team members in New York State may express breast milk for the employee’s nursing child for up to three years following childbirth.  Team members working in Uniswap Labs’ New York City offices have a right to our “Lactation Room,” which is a sanitary place, other than a restroom, that can be used to express breast milk shielded from view and free from intrusion and that includes at a minimum an electrical outlet, a chair, a surface on which to place a breast pump and other personal items, and nearby access to running water.  Uniswap Labs will make reasonable efforts to provide a Lactation Room and a refrigerator suitable for breast milk storage, both in reasonable proximity to the employee’s work area. If the Lactation Room is designated for use for another purpose when not in use for expressing breast milk, the sole function of the room shall be as a Lactation Room while an employee is using the room to express breast milk, and Uniswap Labs shall provide notice to other team members that the room is given preference for use as a lactation room.  Team members may request the use of our Lactation Room by contacting a member of the People Team, and we will direct you to it.  If two or more individuals need to use the Lactation Room at the same time, Uniswap Labs will provide a procedure to follow so that the needs of all those who need to use the Lactation Room can be reasonably accommodated.  If the request for a Lactation Room poses an undue hardship on Uniswap Labs, Uniswap Labs shall engage in an interactive process, as required by law.  Discrimination, harassment and retaliation against an employee who chooses to express breast milk in the work place is strictly prohibited.

California Law  
An employee has the right to request lactation accommodation. To request lactation accommodation, an employee should contact the People team.  Subject to any permissible defenses, Uniswap Labs has an obligation to reasonably accommodate an employee’s request.  If we are not able to accommodate an employee’s request, Uniswap Labs will provide a written response, as required by law. We comply with all applicable laws and expressly prohibits any form of retaliation of discrimination against an individual for requesting or taking lactation periods, or filing a complaint for violations of this policy. Employees have the right to file a complaint with the state’s Labor Commissioner for any violation of a right under the lactation accommodation law, including the prohibition against retaliation. 

Religious Accommodations  
At Uniswap Labs, we are dedicated to treating all of our team members with equal respect. We recognize and celebrate our team of diverse individuals, which includes the rich variety of religious beliefs. In keeping with our value system, we will consider all requests for accommodation should your religious beliefs not align with our Uniswap Labs dress code, your individual schedule, or any other aspect of being part of our team. Please be aware, however, that we may not be able to grant every request. We will always strive to provide reasonable accommodation for our team members' religious beliefs, and at no time will we question the validity of an individual’s belief. If you would like to make a request for a religious accommodation, including time off for a religious holiday, please speak with the People Team. As we have an  unlimited PTO policy, please follow the same notification requirements outlined for vacations, and PTO, unless a shorter time period is necessary, to avoid undue hardship. 

Short-Term Disability Insurance  
Uniswap Labs provides our eligible team members with short-term disability benefits if you are sick and unable to carry out your job duties. These benefits are available to you as long as you are a part of our team as an employee, but will expire on your last day of employment. 

New York State Mandated Disability  
New York State disability benefits insurance also provides temporary cash benefits to our eligible team members when they are disabled by an off the job illness or injury.  
The Disability Benefits Law provides weekly cash benefits to partially replace the wages you might lose due to illnesses or injuries that are unrelated to your job duties. Disability Benefits will only be disbursed in cash, and medical care will be your personal responsibility.

For more information click on [New York State’s disability benefits](http://ww3.nysif.com/DisabilityBenefits.aspx).

Worker’s Compensation

All Uniswap Labs team members are covered by Worker’s Compensation insurance. In the case that you are injured or have an illness sustained in the course of employment that requires medical, surgical, or hospital treatment, please immediately notify your manager and complete an accident report form within twenty-four (24) hours of the accident. No matter how minor an on-the-job injury may appear, it is important that it be reported immediately. Any employee who is injured in the performance of their job and loses time for the day will be paid for the balance of the workday.

Pregnancy Disability Leave  
New York State team members  
New York State disability benefits insurance provides temporary cash benefits to our eligible team members when they are disabled by a non-work related illness or injury, including those arising from pregnancy. In accordance with New York State Law, and subject to applicable state and Federal law, we offer the following benefits and accommodations to our pregnant team members. Our team members are eligible for up to 4 months of pregnancy disability leave with no waiting period if:

●      They have been employed as part of our team for at least three consecutive months as a full-time employee; and

●      They are absent from employment for a period not exceeding up to 4 months for the purpose of giving birth, adopting a child under the age of 18 or adopting a child under the age of 23 if the child is mentally or physically disabled; and

●      They give their employer at least 30 days notice of their anticipated date of departure and intention to return.

California State team members  
A California-based employee is eligible to take California pregnancy disability leave (“PDL”) if they become disabled due to pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions.

Length of Leave Period   
The length of the leave of absence period will be based on the employee’s period of disability as determined by the advice of the employee’s physician, but cannot exceed the number of days or hours the employee would normally work within four calendar months.      

Notice  
To be entitled to PDL, an employee must provide at least 30 days’ advance notice of departure if the need to use PDL is foreseeable.  However, if an employee cannot give 30 days’ advance notice due to the need to use PDL being unforeseeable, the employee must provide as much notice as is practicable.

Other Non-Leave Rights Related to Pregnancy Disability  
An eligible employee who experiences a qualifying event may request a reasonable accommodation, including transfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position (where one is available) or duties if it is medically advisable because of pregnancy-related disability.  The notice requirement described above applies equally to these non-leave rights.  An employee who takes PDL or is granted a transfer as a reasonable accommodation normally will be able to return to the same or comparable position with the same status, pay, length of service credit and seniority as on the date that the leave or reasonable accommodation commenced.

Documentation  
The employee must provide Uniswap Labs with a certification from a health care provider verifying the need for PDL. The certification should contain:

* The date on which the employee became disabled due to pregnancy;  
* The probable duration of the period or periods of disability; and  
* A statement that, due to the disability, the employee is unable to perform one or more of the essential functions of her position without undue risk to herself, the successful completion of her pregnancy, or to other persons.

| How We Work  |
| :---: |

![][image2]

## Wage and Hours/Attendance {#wage-and-hours/attendance}

Our normal workweek is Monday through Friday, anywhere from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., or similar hours, taking into account each respective time zone, including lunchtime. This isn’t a formal guideline, we embrace a flexible working schedule that works best for individual team members, their managers, and collective teams. Each team has different internal rhythms and expectations, so please work with your manager to determine what works best for you and your team.

Getting to work on time and good attendance is required. If you will be late or unable to work that day, you must notify your manager prior to or immediately after your scheduled starting time, and thereafter daily unless other arrangements have been made.

"Absence" is defined as the failure of an employee to report for work when they are scheduled to work. The two types of absences are defined below:

Excused absence occurs when all the following conditions are met:

* The employee provides to their manager sufficient notice of the absence.  
* The absence request is approved by the employee's manager.  
* The employee has requested and their manager has approved PTO

Unexcused absence occurs when any of the above conditions are not met. If it is necessary for an employee to be absent or late for work because of an illness or an emergency, the employee must notify their manager. At our discretion, we may require you to obtain a doctor's note for any medical absence.

Team members who fail to report to work after three consecutive business days without notifying Uniswap Labs of the absence will be considered as having voluntarily resigned as a result of job abandonment.  

Meal and Rest Periods   
New York State team members  
Nonexempt employees working in New York State are entitled to meal periods and rest periods in accordance with all applicable laws.  

* Team members working in New York State who work a shift of more than six (6) hours per day, which extends over the mid-day meal period (between 11:00 a.m. – 2:00 p.m.) are entitled to a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal period to be taken during that mid-day meal period.    
* Those working over six hours, and starting work between 1:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. are entitled to a forty-five (45) minute unpaid meal period taken approximately in the middle of the work period.    
* In addition, those starting a shift before 11:00 a.m. and continuing past 7:00 p.m. are allowed a second unpaid meal period of at least twenty (20) minutes, between 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. 

The failure to take meal periods is a violation of this policy, unless the employee was given the opportunity to take an off-duty meal period but voluntarily and without coercion declined to do so in accordance with applicable law.  Team members must be relieved of all duties during meal periods, and meal periods cannot be saved and taken at the end of a shift.  If at any time an employee feels that he or she is being coerced into working through meal period breaks, the employee should immediately bring a complaint to the People Ops team. 

California State team members  
Nonexempt employees working in California State are entitled, expected and encouraged to take 30-minute, uninterrupted unpaid meal periods as summarized below:

| Duration of Shift in Hours | \# 30-Minute Meal Periods | Details |

| Less than or equal to 5 hours | 0 | A nonexempt employee who does not work more than 5 hours in the shift is not provided with a meal period. |
| More than 5 hours but Less than or equal to 10 hours | 1 | A nonexempt employee is entitled to a 30-minute meal period before completing 5 hours of work in the shift, unless the nonexempt employee is working 6 or fewer hours in the shift and has elected in writing to waive the first meal period. |

Meal periods cannot be taken at the beginning or end of shifts in order to arrive to work late or leave work early.  Non-exempt employees will be relieved of all of their duties during meal periods and are allowed to leave the premises.  If at any time an employee feels they are being coerced into working through a meal period or take a late meal period (i.e., beginning the first meal period after completing 5 hours of work in the shift or beginning a second meal period after completing 10 hours of work in the shift) should promptly speak with their supervisor and/or the People team.

Whenever practicable, employees should take their rest periods near the middle of each four-hour work period during the shift.  Employees may not accumulate rest periods or use rest periods as a basis for starting work late, leaving work early, or extending a meal period. Non-exempt employees also should not leave work premises during a rest period.  
If at any time an employee feels they are being prevented from taking a rest period, the employee should promptly speak with their manager and/or the People and Ops team.

## Pay Period and Deductions {#pay-period-and-deductions}

Uniswap Labs uses a payroll provider called Rippling, and processes all paychecks through an electronic transfer deposit. You will be invited to join this platform on or before your first day. 

Exempt team members are paid semimonthly on the 15th and last day of the month. Non-exempt team members are paid bi-weekly on Fridays. If a payday falls on a weekend or holiday, you will be paid on the last business day before the weekend or holiday. It is your responsibility to review your paycheck for accuracy (paycheck stubs can be found in Rippling) and report any concerns to Finance immediately. If you have been overpaid or underpaid, the error will be corrected as soon as possible.

Uniswap Labs is required by law to make certain deductions from employee's pay each pay period. This includes income and unemployment taxes, Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) contributions (Social Security and Medicare), and any other deductions required under law or by court order for wage garnishments. The amount of tax deductions will depend on earnings and the number of exemptions an employee lists on their federal Form W-4 and applicable state/local withholding forms. 

Team members may also authorize voluntary deductions from their paycheck, including contributions for insurance premiums, retirement plans, spending accounts, or other services. Deductions will be reflected in your wage statement which can be found on Rippling. Uniswap Labs will not make deductions that are prohibited by federal, state, or local law. Questions about deductions and other payroll items should be directed to the People Team. 

Team members will be reimbursed in full for any isolated, inadvertent, or improper deductions, as defined by law. If an error is found, team members will receive an immediate adjustment, which will be paid no later than the next regular payday.

## Record Keeping {#record-keeping}

Uniswap Labs is required by applicable federal, state, and local laws to keep accurate records of hours worked by certain team members. 

Uniswap Labs also must maintain permanent records of each employee relating to matters of pay, benefits, attendance, job performance, etc. These records are for Uniswap Labs purposes and are the property of the Uniswap Labs. Upon written request, team members and former team members may review their personnel file and obtain a copy in accordance with state and federal laws. This is done in the presence of a member of the executive or People  team.

It is important that Uniswap Labs maintain accurate personnel records at all times. You are responsible for notifying your manager or the People Team of any change in name, home address, telephone number, marital status, number of dependents, immigration status, or any other pertinent information. By promptly notifying Uniswap Labs of such changes, you will avoid compromise of your benefit eligibility, the return of W-2 forms, or similar inconvenience.

## Signatory Guidelines {#signatory-guidelines}

From time to time you may need to engage a service provider, partner, or other vendor in the course of your work. All of these types of relationships should be made under a written contract. All such contracts must be prepared or reviewed by the Uniswap Labs legal team.

Contracts may only be signed by an executive (i.e., CEO, CLO, or COO) or by someone else who has been given express authority by the board of directors to sign agreements for the Company or one-off authorization by the CLO. If you have questions, you should check with your manager or the legal team about the appropriate signatory for a contract.

## 

## Remote Work Guidelines {#remote-work-guidelines}

Remote working allows team members to work at home, on the road or in a satellite location for all or part of their workweek, whenever you choose, unless otherwise decided upon for your role. Uniswap Labs considers telecommuting to be a viable, flexible work option.  Telecommuting can be informal, such as working from home for a short-term project or on the road during business travel, or a formal, set schedule of working away from the office. We don’t require anyone to come into the office if their preference is for remote working, but we encourage team members to go into the NY office as often as possible, especially new hires for a week in the first month. This will accelerate relationship and team building, and will help you see first hand what Uniswap Labs culture looks like. In addition, from time to time, your work may entail in-person meetings.

We offer an $8,000 relocation stipend to assist with eligible moves to work from our NYC office.

**New Hires:**

* If you were eligible for the relocation stipend it would have been included in the terms of your offer letter with Uniswap Labs.

**Current Team Members:**

* Speak with your manager about your desire to relocate and if it would be beneficial to your role.   
* If your manager is aligned with your relocation, you must receive approval from the Finance and People team.  
* When your move is confirmed, the $8,000 stipend will be added to your paycheck. (This is a gross amount which will be taxed accordingly.)  
  * *Note:* this will be treated as a bonus from a tax perspective and will be required to be paid back to the company if you leave within one year of the issuance date.

**Retroactive Relocation Approach**: You are not eligible for the relocation stipend if you’d already planned or were in process of moving to NYC before accepting your position with Uniswap Labs.

**Questions?** Reach out to a member of the Finance team.

If you are part time, you may only be eligible to receive some benefits found in this handbook. Full time team members may enroll in benefits on their hire date. We use Rippling as a payroll, benefits, HR, and compliance platform. All full-time U.S team members, their spouses, and dependents are eligible for health coverage on their date of hire.

## Unlimited Paid Time Off (PTO) {#unlimited-paid-time-off-(pto)}

Our team members devote a significant amount of their time to Uniswap Labs’ success. Our Unlimited Paid Time Off (PTO) policy means that, while there is no maximum number of days off you can reasonably be approved to take off, you should take time off in a way that is not disruptive to the business. Our team historically averages around 4 weeks per year as the norm. The calendar year for purposes of this policy is January 1 through December 31\. 

What’s included in PTO:

* Vacation  
* Sick leave  
* Bereavement leave  
* Birthday reprieve   
* Any other time you may just need a break

Uniswap also has an annual end of year break. Refer to the current year's holiday schedule for exact dates.

We encourage all of our team members to utilize this benefit to prioritize holistic care for themselves and those around them. As a team, however, we hold responsibility to each other and ourselves, so we expect our team members to exercise good judgment on when and how to use their PTO. 

Taking PTO

For planned absences, such as for vacation or other known events, team members should request PTO from their Manager and record the time off by using the PTO by Deel app in the Uniswap Labs’s Slack as far in advance as possible. Generally, one week’s notice for your manager for every day you are taking off is the minimum, and more notice is always better.

Eligibility and Pay  
All regular full-time team members are eligible for PTO. Temporary team members and regular part-time team members scheduled to work less than 20 hours per week are not eligible for PTO but are provided with sick time if required by the law applicable in the state or city where the employee works.    
PTO days will be paid at the employee’s base rate of pay at the time of the absence, excluding any other forms of compensation such as bonuses and overtime.  

PTO Considerations

* PTO is not intended for extended personal leaves; please speak to your manager or People team People Team to inquire about an extended leave longer than two consecutive weeks.

* If you are unable to request PTO in advance due to an emergency or unforeseen circumstances, you are expected to notify your Manager as soon as possible.

* An employee’s failure to follow the procedures above may result in Uniswap Labs not approving the use of PTO for the absence.  As a result, you may be denied time off or may have to take the time off without pay and/or be disciplined for taking unexcused time off.

* Uniswap Labs will generally grant reasonable requests for PTO for vacation/personal day purposes when possible, taking business needs into consideration. However, Uniswap Labs reserves the right to deny PTO requests for such purposes in its sole discretion. There is no guarantee that any particular PTO request will be approved (except as may be required under applicable law, including state or local sick leave laws).  Approval will not be given for PTO days under certain circumstances (e.g., where the employee is on a performance improvement plan, after the employee has provided notice of their intent to leave Uniswap Labs and/or if the employee has given two (2) weeks’ notice and requests PTO for the last two (2) weeks of employment).  

* Since Uniswap Labs has an unlimited PTO policy and PTO is not earned or accrued, there will be no pay-out of PTO or vacation upon separation from employment for any reason, except where required otherwise by law. 

* We prohibit discrimination or retaliation against any employee for taking PTO for Sick Leave Purposes.

## Holidays {#holidays}

Uniswap Labs generally observes 14 paid holidays during the calendar year for U.S. team members.  Unless otherwise announced by Uniswap Labs for a given year, the holidays are:

Holiday pay will be calculated based on the employee’s base pay rate (as of the date of the holiday) times the number of hours the employee would otherwise have worked on that day, excluding overtime hours.  To be eligible for holiday pay, non-exempt team members must be regularly scheduled to work on the day on which the holiday is observed and must work their regularly scheduled working days immediately preceding and immediately following the holiday.  Temporary team members and part-time team members regularly scheduled to work less than 20 hours per week are not eligible for paid holidays.

## Requesting PTO for Sick Leave Purposes {#requesting-pto-for-sick-leave-purposes}

## New York HERO Act  \- Airborne Infectious Disease Exposure Prevention Plan

A copy of the Uniswap Labs Airborne Infectious Disease Exposure Prevention Plan under the New York HERO Act is posted in the Uniswap Labs New York office and distributed to New York team members. You can also find that information below: 

[**NYS HERO ACT**](https://dol.ny.gov/ny-hero-act)

The New York Health and Essential Rights Act (NY HERO Act) was signed into law on May 5, 2021\. The law mandates extensive new workplace health and safety protections in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of the NY HERO Act is to protect employees against exposure and disease during a future airborne infectious disease outbreak. 

Under this law, the New York State Department of Labor (NYS DOL), in consultation with the NYS Department of Health, has developed an Airborne Infectious Disease Exposure Prevention Standard, a Model Airborne Infectious Disease Exposure Prevention Plan, and various industry-specific model plans for the prevention of airborne infectious disease. Employers can choose to adopt the applicable policy template/plan provided by NYS DOL or establish an alternative plan that meets or exceeds the standard’s minimum requirements.

The airborne infectious disease exposure prevention plans must go into effect when an airborne infectious disease is designated by the New York State Commissioner of Health as a highly contagious communicable disease that presents a serious risk of harm to the public health. When designated, employers are required to provide a copy of the adopted airborne infectious disease exposure prevention plan and post the same in a visible and prominent location within each worksite. Templates and resources are available below. 

On March 17, 2022, the designation of COVID-19 as an airborne infectious disease that presents a serious risk of harm to the public health under the HERO Act ended. Private sector employers are no longer required to implement their workforce safety plans.

Inquiries about the HERO Act can be emailed to Airborne.Infectious.Diseases@labor.ny.gov.

## Parental and Family Leave  {#parental-and-family-leave}

We are proud to offer paid leave to any of our team members who need to care for any new addition to their family, whether by birth, adoption, or placement. We know that our team members do best when they feel supported outside of the workplace, so we want to ensure that we do our best to help make your transition into parenthood a joyous one\!

Birthing mothers will be entitled to up to 16 weeks (4 months) with all other parents entitled up to 12 weeks (3 months). 

Regular full-time team members are eligible for this policy on their first day of employment.

Uniswap Parental Leave may be taken on an intermittent (non-consecutive) basis with the approval of the employee’s manager and a member of the People Operations team, or to the extent an employee is entitled to intermittent leave under applicable law. An intermittent leave will require a detailed plan of when the team member will be on leave vs working and include the desired length of each part of the leave used. The People Team and the employees manager will review and approve.

The pay benefits provided by Uniswap Labs under this policy will supplement any pay benefits to which the employee may be entitled, and in no case will pay from all sources exceed 100% of the employee’s regular base salary.  

How to Apply for Leave

Return to Work  
During Uniswap Parental Leave, your job will be held for you in accordance with applicable law.  Please note that team members have no greater right to reinstatement under this policy than if they had been continuously employed rather than on leave.    
Nothing in this policy affects your status as an at-will employee. Uniswap Labs prohibits discrimination or retaliation against any employee for taking Uniswap Parental Leave.  If you have any questions, please speak to a member of the People Ops team.

Our parental leave policy complements, and will not contradict the [New York State Paid Family Leave (NYPFL)](https://paidfamilyleave.ny.gov/) and the [Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla). If you need further clarification on these policies, consult our People Ops Leader and/or either of the policies mentioned in this handbook.

PFL benefits are generally not available for an employee’s own serious health condition (except for certain limited situations for certain team members when the employee is under an order of quarantine or isolation due to COVID-19).  For purposes of this policy, the following definitions apply:

* “Family member” means an employee’s parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, spouse or domestic partner. Beginning on January 1, 2023, “family member” will also include siblings.  
* “Serious health condition” means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves (i) inpatient care in a hospital, hospice or residential health care facility, or (ii) continuing treatment or continuing supervision by a health care provider, including but not limited to preparation for and recovery from surgery related to organ or tissue donation.    
* “Qualifying exigency” has the meaning as it is defined under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act and includes, for example, attending to child care or parental care arrangements, financial and legal arrangements, counseling, military events, post-deployment events, and spending time with a covered military family member on short-term Rest and Recuperation leave.

Duration of Leave and Increments of Use  
The PFL law provides for up to 12 weeks of leave in a 52-week period. The 52-week period is a “rolling” 52-week period measured backward with respect to each day for which PFL benefits are claimed. Leave may be taken on an intermittent basis in increments of one full day (or one fifth of the weekly benefit).

Eligibility and Payroll Deductions  
Team members who work 20 or more hours per week are eligible after completing 26 consecutive weeks of employment. Team members who work less than 20 hours per week are eligible after 175 days of employment. PFL benefits are financed through payroll deductions, which may begin prior to the commencement of coverage, in accordance with New York State law. Team members whose work schedules will not allow the employee to become eligible for PFL coverage will be offered the option to be exempted from payroll deductions for PFL coverage and waive PFL benefits by completing [this form](http://docs.paidfamilyleave.ny.gov/content/main/forms/PFLDocs/PFLWaiver.pdf) and providing it to a member of the People Ops team.  

Pay and Benefits During PFL  
During PFL, team members receive a certain percentage of their average weekly wage, up to a cap of the New York State Average Weekly Wage (“NYSAWW”).  For leave commencing effective January 1, 2021, eligible team members will receive 67% of their average weekly wage, up to a cap of 67% of the NYSAWW.  During the leave, Uniswap Labs will maintain an employee’s group health insurance coverage on the same terms as if the employee had not taken leave, and the employee will be required to continue making contributions on the same terms as if he or she had not taken leave.  

How to Apply for PFL  
If the need for leave is foreseeable, team members must give Uniswap Labs at least 30 days’ written notice before the date that the leave is expected to begin, or, if not foreseeable, as soon as practicable.  Failure to provide timely notice may result in a delay or partial denial of benefits.  An employee who seeks to use PFL will be required to submit a claim form to Guardian (through Sequoia), the Uniswap Labs’s PFL insurance carrier, along with documentation supporting their need for leave (e.g., birth certificate, medical certification or military deployment papers).  Please contact a member of the People Ops team for the required forms.  Forms are also available from the Uniswap Labs’s PFL insurance carrier and from the New York State website [here](http://www.ny.gov/new-york-state-paid-family-leave/paid-family-leave-forms-team%20members-employers-and-insurance-carriers). 

Upon an employee’s return from PFL, to the full extent required by law Uniswap Labs will reinstate the employee to the employee’s original position or, if no longer available, to an equivalent position with equivalent terms and conditions of employment, including pay and employment benefits, in accordance with applicable law; provided that an employee returning from PFL has no greater right to reinstatement than if the employee had been continuously employed.  Retaliation against an employee who requests or takes PFL is strictly prohibited.  

Coordination of PFL with Other Leaves  
To the extent that an employee’s leave qualifies for both PFL and any other leave(s), PFL will run concurrently with all other leaves, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and policies.  To the extent that team members are eligible for both short-term disability benefits and PFL benefits during the same period, team members may not concurrently receive both benefits (except in certain limited situations related to COVID-19).  An employee’s combined short-term disability benefits and PFL benefits may not exceed 26 weeks in the same 52-week period.    
PTO may not be used concurrently to supplement PFL benefits.

California Family Right Acts Leave  
This policy is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of the California Family Rights Act (“CFRA”) provisions governing parental leave.  

Eligibility  
A California-based employee is eligible for a leave under this policy if he or she (i) has worked for Uniswap Labs for at least 12 months prior to the date on which the leave is to commence; and (ii) has worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period preceding the leave.  

Leave Entitlement  
CFRA leave may be up to 12 workweeks in a 12-month period, within any 12-month rolling period, for any of the following reasons:

* The birth, adoption, or foster care placement of your child.  
* To care for your own serious health condition.  
* To care for the serious health condition of your child, spouse, domestic partner, parent, including parent-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling.  
* a qualifying exigency related to the covered active duty or call to covered active duty of an employee's spouse, domestic partner, child, or parent, including parent-in-law in the US Armed Forces. 

Notice  
An employee must provide at least 30 days’ advance notice of departure.  However, if an employee cannot give 30 days’ advance notice due to circumstances beyond his or her control, the employee may provide less notice as long as the employee provides as much notice as is practicable.

Returning to Work  
Upon an employee’s return from PFL, Uniswap Labs will reinstate the employee to his or her original position or, if no longer available, to an equivalent position with equivalent terms and conditions of employment, including pay and employment benefits, in accordance with applicable law. Use of PFL cannot result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued before the start of PFL that was not used during the leave.

Non-Retaliation & Additional Information  
The Uniswap Labs prohibits discrimination or retaliation against an employee who requests or takes leave under this policy.  For additional information about PFL leave, please contact the People Ops team.

## Additional Leave of Absence Policies  {#additional-leave-of-absence-policies}

To further support our team members in their most vulnerable moments, we also have coverage with the following policies:

Jury Duty   
Uniswap Labs encourages team members to fulfill their civic responsibilities to serve on state and federal juries.  Team members who are summoned or otherwise requested to serve on jury duty must inform their Manager immediately so arrangements can be made to accommodate their absence. Team members are expected to report to work when the court schedule permits, for example, if team members are excused from jury duty during their regularly scheduled business hours or if they are released from jury duty earlier than anticipated.  
Team members serving on jury duty will continue to receive their base rate of pay for up to the first 3 work days of jury duty service. Team members will be placed on unpaid leave for any remaining time of jury duty service provided that team members who report to work during jury duty will be paid for all time worked. Exempt team members may be provided time off with pay when necessary to comply with state and federal wage and hour laws. Uniswap Labs reserves the right to request proof of jury service issued by the Court upon return to work.  

Time Off to Vote  
Uniswap Labs complies with all state laws that provide for time off from work in order for an employee to vote.  Team members eligible for PTO may use PTO if time off from work is needed to vote.    

## Crime, Victim or Witness Leave 

Uniswap Labs provides team members who are the victim of a violent felony or serious felony (or the family member of a victim of a violent felony or serious felony) with leave, coordinated with our PTO and leave of absence policy, in order to attend judicial proceedings related to the crime.   
A family member under this policy includes a spouse, domestic partner, child, stepchild, brother, stepbrother, sister, stepsister, mother, stepmother, father, or stepfather. 

When the need for leave is foreseeable, you must provide documentation of the scheduled proceeding. Such notice is typically given to the victim of the crime by a court or government agency setting the hearing, a district attorney or prosecuting attorney's office, or a victim/witness office. If advance notice is not possible, you must provide appropriate documentation within a reasonable time after the absence. Uniswap Labs will not retaliate against team members who request or take leave in accordance with this policy.

We also have coverage with the following NYS policies:

* [NYS Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA)](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla): Provides 12 weeks of unpaid leave with job protection (in a 12 month period) to eligible team members for specified medical health and/or family reasons. Click the link for more details, and eligibility information.  
* [New York Paid Family Leave](https://paidfamilyleave.ny.gov/): Provides eligible team members with job protected paid leave to bond with newly born, adopted, or fostered children, care for a family member with health issues, or support  immediate family members with active military leave. Click the link for more details, and eligibility information.  
* [Military Leave (USERRA)](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/vets/programs/userra/USERRA-Pocket-Guide): Provides eligible team members with job protection and reemployment rights, when taking a voluntary or involuntary leave of absence for active military service. Click the link for more details, and eligibility information.  
* [NYS Voting Leave Law](https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/TimeOffToVoteNotice.pdf): Provides team members (who do not have sufficient time outside of working hours to vote on election day) with up to 2 hours of Paid Time Off to vote. Click the link for more details.  
* [Blood and Bone Marrow Donation](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/LAB/202-J): Provides team members with up to three hours in any 12 month period to donate blood (or the ability to donate blood during work hours twice per year). Click the link for more details.

## COBRA  {#cobra}

The federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) gives an opportunity for eligible team members and their beneficiaries to continue health insurance for a limited period of time under our organization’s insurance plan in the case of qualifying instances like voluntary or involuntary job loss, reduction in the hours worked, transition between jobs, death, divorce, and other life events. Under COBRA, each individual pays the full cost of coverage at Uniswap Labs’ group rate plus an administrative fee.

Length of Coverage  
Coverage may continue for differing lengths of time depending upon the reason for eligibility. The time limitations include but are not limited to:

* Up to 18 months if loss of coverage is due to termination of employment or reduction in work hours  
* Up to 36 months for dependents if loss of coverage is due to death, divorce, or a dependent child’s loss of eligibility  
* Up to 29 months if the individual is disabled at the time of eligibility for continued coverage or is disabled within 60 days of eligibility for continued coverage

Termination of Continued Coverage  
Continued coverage may terminate if:

* The individual becomes covered by another group plan (including Medicare)  
* The employer no longer offers the plan(s) to its active team members.

## Conflicts of Interest  {#conflicts-of-interest}

A conflict of interest exists when an employee’s actions or commitments are divided between Uniswap Labs and another business or individual. Uniswap Labs expects that all officers, team members, and independent contractors avoid situations that may create actual, potential or perceived conflict between personal interests and the interests of Uniswap Labs. As with any situation, please use good judgment to maintain a high standard of ethics and integrity as a Uniswap Labs employee.  
These guidelines address common activities where conflicts may arise and outline a process for team members to clear any potential conflicts with the Uniswap Labs legal team. 

Potential conflicts include: 

1. Advisor Roles and Outside Employment  
   Uniswap Labs supports team members in working on companies and projects outside of Uniswap Labs as directors, advisors, or contributors, with certain limitations as long as:   
   * The company or project doesn’t directly or indirectly compete with the business or the interests of Uniswap Labs  
   * The activities are unrelated to your role and work at Uniswap Labs  
   * The activities do not interfere with your performance and duties at Uniswap Labs. 

   If the outside company or project doesn’t meet any of these criteria, or takes more than 5 hours per week, please follow the [Clearing Process](#how-to-clear-any-potential-conflicts-of-interest:). 

2. Outside Investments and Trading  
   When you have confidential or sensitive information about Uniswap Labs and you want to trade a digital asset or other types of property, please follow the [Uniswap Labs Non-Public Information Trading Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K5xxuQ4Wm0oM-tN8Ll1JNlo4ZcmXzj0aXP9Fpcsvj1I/edit).   
   Note: If you are actively involved in Uniswap Labs’ venture investment workstreams, you may not invest in any blockchain or crypto-based project unless it has (1) already been vetted by Uniswap Labs Ventures, and (2) you have followed the [Clearing Process](#how-to-clear-any-potential-conflicts-of-interest:).  
     
     
     
3. Employment Decisions   
   You may not influence any decision to hire, compensate, or dismiss any person or employee to whom you have family, romantic, or other pre-existing social relationship without first disclosing your relationship through the [Clearing Process](#how-to-clear-any-potential-conflicts-of-interest:) and following the [Hiring Family Members guidelines below.](#hiring-family-members)   
     
4. Confidential Information  
   You may not disclose confidential information about Uniswap Labs or about any third parties that you may learn as part of your employment at Uniswap Labs.  
     
5. Excessive Gifting  
   Please don’t offer or accept substantial gifts, entertainment, favors, payments, or tokens/ assets, from partners, other crypto projects, or anyone else if it could give the appearance of undue influence or otherwise be improper or embarrassing to Uniswap Labs. You may not give or accept anything from any foreign official, politician, or political candidate in your capacity as an employee of Uniswap Labs (this does not limit lawful personal political contributions).   
   Note: If you would like to give or receive anything over $200 in connection with your role at Uniswap Labs, please follow the [Clearing Process](#how-to-clear-any-potential-conflicts-of-interest:) first. 

### How to clear any potential conflicts of interest: {#how-to-clear-any-potential-conflicts-of-interest:}

If you are unsure whether an activity, transaction or relationship might result in a conflict of interest, please raise the potential conflict of interest to the legal team for additional insight and clearance.   
First, email [legal@uniswap.org](mailto:legal@uniswap.org) and include the following: 

* details about the potential conflict, including the nature of the activity  
* the amount of any investment involved  
* the amount of time you are involved with the activity  
* whether you are or the activity is affiliated with Uniswap Labs Ventures

Next, the legal team will work with others (your manager, and/or the executive team) to review the activity and assess whether there is a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest. The legal team may ask you questions regarding the activity and your work for Uniswap Labs as a part of this process.

Finally, the legal team will follow up with you in writing via email with a determination as to whether the activity is approved or not and will endeavor to do so within seven days.

Failure to follow these guidelines may result in discipline, including termination. The guidelines in this document do not limit any of your rights under law, including Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, or prohibit you from filing a complaint with, or otherwise cooperating with or participating in any government investigation or proceeding involving Uniswap Labs.

## Relationships in the Workplace {#relationships-in-the-workplace}

We want to support your whole self in and out of work. To that end, romantic or intimate relationships at work – where one person has real or implied authority over the other – may create opportunities for bias to creep in.

If you find yourself in such a relationship, please connect with your People Business Partner.

***Who does this apply to:*** All people in the UL community – team members, contractors, interns, fellows, and advisors. And keep in mind that managers aren’t the only ones with authority.

Best practices if romantically involved with a coworker:

* Please be professional while at work/work events  
* Connect with Megan or Kee to chat about what to be mindful of

**What happens if we share with the People team?**

* If one of you is a manager, we’ll talk about risks related to bias (reporting lines, ways of working etc.) and options to remedy any kind of power imbalance.  
* If neither of you is a manager or in a role with authority over the other, we’ll chat about what to do if that changes and things to be mindful of as peers.  
* We aren’t tracking or keeping records of people dating. We won’t probe further unless needed for work.  
* We won’t share your information with anyone without your knowledge, and will only share if the person needs to know (e.g., if reporting lines are in conflict, need to shift someone’s manager).

## Candidate Referrals 

We welcome you to submit candidates in your network who might be a good fit for open roles. However, submission is just that: a first step. We uphold a rigorous talent acquisition process that includes ensuring each role is open to many diverse candidates, so that doesn't necessarily mean that your referral is a shoe-in. We know that our business will become better by keeping our standards high in the recruiting and hiring process. You can learn more and stay up to date [here](https://www.notion.so/uniswaplabs/Uniswap-Employee-Referral-Bonus-Program-abe01fed846447c580b723c6127475a5).

Eligibility for the referral bonus program

The referral bonus program is eligible to all team members except for the Executive team, recruiting team members, and the Manager for a specific role on their team. 

* Eligible roles: All full-time roles  
* Non-eligible roles:  
  * Contractor/Consulting  
  * Part-time roles  
  * Internships

## 

## Hiring Family Members  {#hiring-family-members}

Uniswap Labs is committed to ensuring you have the opportunity of advancement based on qualifications and merit, and not discriminated in favor of or in opposition to the employment of relatives. Due to potential for perceived or actual conflicts, such as favoritism or personal conflicts from outside the work environment, Uniswap Labs will hire relatives of team members only if: a) candidates will not be working directly for or supervising a relative, and b) candidates will not occupy a position in the same line of authority in which team members can initiate or participate in decisions involving a direct benefit to the relative. Such decisions include hiring, retention, transfer, promotion, wages and leave requests.

"Family member" is defined as one of the following: spouse or significant other, parent/step parent, child/step child, grandparent, grandchild, brother/brother-in-law, sister/sister-in-law, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, first cousin, in-laws (father, mother, son daughter).

Procedure  
Prior to the employment offer, the Hiring Manager must complete a signed statement certifying that the candidate for employment is a relative as defined above. Failure to submit the signed statement to the People Team will result in the delay of the job offer until the statement is submitted. The Hiring Manager is responsible for ensuring policy compliance and for monitoring changes in employee reporting relations after initial hire. Team members are responsible for immediately reporting any changes to their Hiring Manager.

If any employee, after employment or change in employment, enters into one of the above relationships, one of the affected individuals must seek a transfer or a change in the reporting relationship. Such changes must be approved by the People Team. If a decision cannot be made by the affected team members within 14 days of reporting, reassignment will be made on direction of the team director and the People Team.

## Workplace Violence and Substance Abuse {#workplace-violence-and-substance-abuse}

## Workplace Violence

## Uniswap Labs has a zero tolerance for acts of violence and threats of violence.  Without exception, acts and threats of violence are not permitted. All such acts and threats, even those made in apparent jest, will be taken seriously and will lead to appropriate discipline, up to and including termination.  Weapons, including firearms, are not permitted on Uniswap Labs premises.

If you are threatened, or the victim of a violent act in the workplace, or if you observe behavior that is violent, or potentially violent (as described above), immediately report it to your manager or the People Team. This includes threats or violent acts by co-workers, customers, visitors, or others who have come onto Uniswap Labs premises as well as occurrences off-premises but during the Uniswap Labs’s business/functions.

All reports of workplace violence will be taken seriously and will be investigated promptly and thoroughly.  We will maintain confidentiality when possible (i.e., release information only to those with a business need-to-know).  We will not tolerate retaliation against any employee who reports workplace violence.  

In order to promote a safe and violence-free workplace, we reserve the right to inspect, without notice to the employee and/or in the employee’s absence, any desks, offices, packages, purses, backpacks and any other personal items brought onto Uniswap Labs property.  Any employee who does not consent to and fully cooperate with such inspections is subject to corrective action up to and including immediate termination.

## 

## Substance Abuse 

Uniswap Labs is concerned about the use of alcohol, illegal drugs, and controlled substances as they affect the workplace.  This policy applies to conduct on Uniswap Labs premises at any time (whether or not the employee is working) and to conduct during work hours, including paid and unpaid breaks and meal periods (whether or not on premises) or while on Uniswap Labs business (whether or not on premises).  Any Uniswap Labs reference to controlled substances in this policy or otherwise shall include marijuana, including physician-prescribed marijuana, unless otherwise stated.    
With one exception as described below, the following are strictly prohibited by Uniswap Labs:

1. The possession or use, or being under the influence of, alcohol, illegal drugs, or a controlled substance while on the job, unless the use of the controlled substance is consistent with a physician’s prescription that is lawful under federal and state law and does not impair the employee’s ability to work satisfactorily or pose a risk to workplace safety.

2. Driving a Uniswap Labs-provided vehicle (whether or not the employee is working) or driving on business (whether or not in a Uniswap Labs-provided vehicle) while under the influence of alcohol, illegal drugs, or a controlled substance; and

3. Distribution, dispensation, sale, or purchase of an illegal or controlled substance while on the job. 

The one exception to this policy is the moderate, responsible consumption of alcohol at a Uniswap Labs sponsored event that does not impair the employee’s judgment or performance;  however, under no circumstances may an employee drive while under the influence of alcohol, and team members must make *prior* arrangements for safe, alternate transportation from the event.

Marijuana/Cannabis. While marijuana has been legalized in some states, including New York, for medical and/or recreational use, it remains an illegal drug under federal law, and its use as it impacts the workplace is prohibited. Except where permitted by applicable law, Uniswap Labs does not discriminate against team members solely on the basis of their off-duty and off-site use without use of any Uniswap Labs equipment or other property of (i) medical marijuana in compliance with state medical marijuana laws, or (ii) recreational marijuana in compliance with state recreational marijuana laws.    
If an employee has a medical condition that qualifies as a “disability” under applicable law (including but not limited to New York team members with a serious condition who have been issued a patient certification and registry identification card for the use of medical marijuana under the New York Public Health Law, Sections 3360-3369-E), the employee may seek a reasonable accommodation to allow them to perform the essential functions of their job that does not pose an undue hardship to Uniswap Labs.  To request a reasonable accommodation for a medical condition that qualifies as a “disability” under applicable law,  please see the [Uniswap Labs’s policy on Reasonable Accommodations for Disabilities, Pregnancy, Religious Observances and Needs Related to Domestic Violence, Sex Offenses or Stalking](#reasonable-accommodations:-disability,-nursing-mothers-and-religious).

Team members are encouraged to notify their managers in advance if their use of any over-the-counter medication or properly prescribed drug may affect their work performance.    
Violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Uniswap Labs also may bring the matter to the attention of appropriate law enforcement authorities.  

## Other Prohibited Conduct

Our team members must be aware of their responsibilities to Uniswap Labs and to co-workers and clients.  We strive to take a constructive approach to disciplinary matters to reasonably ensure that actions, which would interfere with operations or an employee’s job, are not continued.

Although there is no way to identify every possible violation of standards of conduct, the following is a partial list of infractions which are prohibited and will not be tolerated: unexcused absenteeism or lateness for work and work functions; unlawful harassment, including sexual harassment; engaging in acts of dishonesty, lack of integrity, fraud, theft or sabotage; threatening, intimidating, coercing, using abusive or vulgar language, or interfering with the performance of other team members; lack of accountability, insubordination or refusal to comply with instructions or failure to perform reasonable duties which are assigned; unauthorized use of Uniswap Labs material, time, equipment or property. 

The list above is intended to be representative of the types of activities which may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.  It is not intended to be comprehensive and does not alter the employment-at-will relationship between the employee and Uniswap Labs.  Additional standards of conduct are described in this handbook.

### Criminal Activity, Arrests and Reporting

Uniswap Labs will report all criminal activity in accordance with applicable law. Involvement in criminal activity while employed by us, whether on or off Uniswap Labs property, may result in disciplinary action including suspension or termination of employment.

Uniswap Labs conducts background checks on all incoming new employees. In the event that you leave Uniswap Labs and return as a rehire, you will be subject to complete another background check at the time of rehire.

## Compliance With Anti-Corruption and Anti-Money Laundering Laws

# 1\.          	Policy and Purpose

# Universal Navigation Inc. (the “Company” or “Uniswap”) is committed to conducting its business ethically and in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other applicable anti-corruption laws (collectively, “Anti-Corruption Laws”), as well as applicable U.S. anti-money laundering (“AML”) laws (“AML Laws”).  Compliance is critical to the Company’s continued success and our ability to maintain our reputation for responsible corporate citizenship.

This Policy on Compliance with Anti-Corruption and AML Laws (the “Policy”) is designed to familiarize you with Anti-Corruption and AML Laws.  Nothing in this Policy limits the scope or requirements of other policies that the Company has enacted or may enact in the future. 

## Under this Policy, neither the Company nor any employee or other person acting on the Company’s behalf may take any action in violation of, or fail to take any action consistent with and/or required by, this Policy or Anti-Corruption or AML Laws.  Violations of this Policy or applicable Anti-Corruption or AML Laws will be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

It is impossible to predict and describe every situation prohibited under Anti-Corruption or AML Laws, so it is important that you adopt both the spirit and the letter of this Policy.  Moreover, if you believe that any employee, contractor, or other individual has violated this Policy or Anti-Corruption or AML Laws, you must report the potential violation to the Legal Team.  We strictly prohibit any retaliation by the Company against you for making any such report.  
Relevant employees are expected to become familiar and comply with this Policy, to participate in training when requested by the Company, and to communicate the values underlying this Policy in interactions with colleagues.

# 2\.          	Scope and Applicability

## This Policy applies to all Company personnel, wherever located.  The Company also expects any third parties that act on the Company’s behalf, including agents and other intermediaries, to understand and fully comply with their obligations under Anti-Corruption and AML Laws. Failure to comply will be grounds for immediate termination of the business relationship with that third party.

# 3\.          	Legal Team

# The Legal Team is responsible for implementing and providing guidance and interpretation on matters related to this Policy.  The Legal Team, with assistance from the Human Resources Department, is also responsible for overseeing the investigation of any information or allegations concerning possible violations of any Anti-Corruption or AML Laws or this Policy.  The Legal Team has authority to retain and consult with outside legal counsel in the execution of duties.

The Legal Team will participate in training programs or seek advice from outside counsel to stay current on best practices and changes in the topics outlined in this Policy.  The Legal Team will maintain records documenting such training or advice and the topics covered therein for at least five (5) years.  Additionally, the Legal Team will ensure that any necessary updates are made to the Company’s policies, procedures, and processes, and that appropriate employees are educated on such matters.

If you have any questions regarding this Policy or suspect a violation of this Policy, please contact the Legal Team at legal@uniswap.

# 4\.          	The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)

## 4.1       	Overview

## In relevant part, the FCPA prohibits the Company and its employees, agents, officers, directors, and shareholders from offering, paying, promising to pay, or authorizing the payment of any money, or offering, gifting, promising to gift, or authorizing the giving of *anything of value* to any Foreign Official, any foreign political party or official thereof, any candidate for foreign political office, or any other person, while knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing of value will be offered, given, or promised, directly or indirectly, to any such person for the purpose of:

* Influencing any act or decision of such person in his official capacity;  
* Inducing such person to do or omit to do any act in violation of the lawful duty of such official;  
* Securing any improper advantage; or  
* Inducing such person to use his influence with a foreign government or instrumentality thereof to affect or influence any act or decision of such government or instrumentality,

in each case in order to assist such person in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person.

The FCPA contains an exception for certain “facilitation payments” made to facilitate certain routine, non-discretionary government functions; however, because the anti-corruption laws of many other jurisdictions (*e.g.*, the UK Bribery Act, the Swiss Criminal Code) do not contain any such exception, the Company prohibits any “facilitation payments.”

## 4.2       	Foreign Officials

The term “Foreign Official” includes all officers or employees of any non-U.S. national, state, provincial, or local government and all their departments and agencies, regardless of rank or position.  It also includes employees of state-owned or state-controlled entities.

## 4.3       	Anything of Value

The term “anything of value” is very broad and can include, for example: cash, gift cards, gifts, hospitality (*e.g.*, travel, meals, lodging, entertainment), loans, non-arm’s length transactions, charitable or political donations, and business, employment, or investment opportunities.  There are limited exceptions for reasonable and bona fide business expenditures directly related to the promotion, demonstration, or explanation of the Company’s products or services. 

## 4.4       	Third Parties and Knowledge

The FCPA prohibits corrupt offers, promises, and payments through intermediaries, such as agents, consultants, partners, and other representatives. The Company may be liable for indirect offers, promises, or payments made through the Company’s agent, joint venture partner, or other third-party intermediary, if such actions are taken with knowledge—including a reason to know, or conscious disregard—that a corrupt payment or transfer is likely to occur.  For this reason, it is critical that all personnel monitor and report any “red flags” suggesting any potential non-compliance by the Company’s third-party intermediaries. 

## 4.5       	How the Company Complies with Anti-Corruption Laws

### (a)        	*Prohibited Payments*

The Company strictly prohibits anyone covered by this Policy from directly or indirectly making, promising, authorizing, offering, or accepting anything of value, by or on behalf of the Company, to or from any person in order to secure an improper advantage (*e.g.*, a regulatory approval), obtain or retain business, or direct business to any other person or entity.  This prohibition includes payments to third parties where you know, or have reason to know, that the third party will use any part of the payment for bribes or other corrupt payments.

Unless permitted by this Policy or by written approval from the Legal Team, no offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization to pay or provide any money, gifts, entertainment, travel, or anything else of value will be made, solicited, or accepted, by or on behalf of the Company, to or from any person, including any Foreign Official.  These prohibitions apply to payments or offers to pay or give anything of value, whether or not they involve the use of corporate resources (*e.g.*, personal expenditure or entertainment).

### (b)       	*Cash Payments*

Cash payments of any kind to a third party, other than documented petty cash disbursements or other valid and approved payments, are prohibited.  Company checks shall not be written to “cash,” “bearer,” or anyone other than the party entitled to payment, except to replenish properly used petty cash funds.

### (c)        	*Hospitality*

The FCPA permits certain payments for reasonable and bona fide expenses that are *directly related* to the promotion, demonstration, or explanation of the Company’s products and services.  As such, the Company abides by the following practices:

* Any travel or entertainment expenses must be limited solely to those individuals necessary for the furtherance of the Company’s business.  No payments can be authorized for travel or entertainment expenses for spouses or guests.  
* All travel and entertainment expenses must be accurately and adequately documented in the books and records of the Company, including the purpose or value of these expenses.  
* Legitimate gifts, meals, and entertainment are permitted only if they are of nominal value, infrequent, and not offered for an improper purpose.  Prior approval from the Legal Team is required for all gifts, meals, and entertainment with a value of greater than $50.

Any proposed provision of travel or lodging must be described in writing to the Legal Team, who alone has the authority to approve the request.

### (d)       	*Facilitation Payments*

The Company prohibits “facilitation payments” (*i.e.*, small payments to facilitate routine, non-discretionary government functions), which are illegal under the anti-corruption laws of many other countries.

### (e)        	*Political and Charitable Contributions*

Unless permitted by written approval from the Legal Team, no money, assets, property, or other thing of value of the Company may be contributed, loaned, or made available to any candidate, party, or political committee.

Under no circumstances may charitable contributions be made at the suggestion, request, or at the behest of any Foreign Official to obtain any improper advantage or to a charity owned, controlled, or connected to a Foreign Official.

### (f)         	*Books, Records, and Accounting*

The Company maintains books and accounting records that accurately reflect all transactions in reasonable detail.  These recordkeeping requirements apply to all payments (including the types described above), not merely those that would be material in the traditional financial sense.

Officers, directors, employees, contractors, and third parties are prohibited from manipulating books or records in an effort to mask transactions, either by characterizing them in some oblique way or by omitting them from the Company’s books or records entirely.  Accordingly, no undisclosed or unrecorded accounts may be maintained for any purpose.

### (g)        	*Relationships with Agents and Other Third Parties*

The Company strictly prohibits using an agent, consultant, intermediary, or other third party acting on the Company’s behalf to make a payment or gift that would be prohibited by our Policy if made by the Company or its employees.  The actions of third parties present particular risks because, in certain circumstances, the Company and its employees can be held liable for improper payments made by a third party, even if the Company did not have actual knowledge of the payment.      

# 5\.          	Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Laws

Money laundering is the process by which those involved in criminal activities conceal the source of and disguise the nature of illicit funds by making them appear legitimate.  The Company is not a financial institution required under AML Laws to maintain a formal anti-money laundering policy.  But because participating in or facilitating a financial transaction that involves the proceeds of illegal activity may constitute a money laundering crime, the Company’s policy is not to facilitate money laundering.  Although the Company does not conduct any special diligence to determine the source fund of its investors or other counterparties, the Company reserves the right to refuse to do business with any person, including as a vendor or person providing financing to or an investment in the Company, if the Company believes that such person presents a money laundering risk.  In particular, the Company may refuse to conduct business with any person that it has reason to believe is not engaged in a legitimate business (including persons whose funds are directly or indirectly proceeds of crime) or does not have a legitimate source of wealth. 

In the event that the Company is required to refund or otherwise to return or distribute funds, it is the Company’s policy to make the payment of the amount due to the same person that made the initial payment or investment and to the same account or payment method by which the original payment, or from which the original investment, was made, unless the Company receives a satisfactory explanation for some other payment procedure.  The Company’s policy is to make payments to third parties only (i) in exchange for legitimate products, services, and/or property provided to the Company having a value equivalent to the amount paid; (ii) in satisfaction of the Company’s legal obligations; or (iii) in connection with distributions to the Company’s investors.

# 6\.          	Employee Obligations

## 6.1       	Reporting Obligations

Employees should be alert for red flags or other suspicious circumstances that indicate potential violations of Anti-Corruption or AML Laws.  Deliberately ignoring or otherwise failing to take appropriate action in the face of suspicious circumstances may lead to liability and penalties under U.S. law for the Company and/or its employees.

Employees must promptly report to the Legal Team any suspected or actual violation of this Policy by the Company, any of its officers, directors, or employees, or any third party (such as agents, consultants, or representatives) acting on the Company’s behalf.  Once an employee has made a report, the employee has an obligation to update the report with new information.

## Under no circumstances shall the reporting of any such information or possible violation serve as a basis for any retaliatory actions to be taken against any employee making the report.

## 6.2       	Training Obligations

The Company is committed to maintaining a compliance program and a business environment that highly emphasizes compliance and ethical business practices.  In furtherance of these goals, the Company may provide trainings regarding anti-corruption or AML compliance issues that the Company identifies from time to time.  All relevant employees have an obligation to attend such trainings, review any materials that may be distributed (including this Policy), and remain knowledgeable about compliance with this Policy.

## 6.3       	Third-Party Due Diligence Obligations

Employees have an obligation to ensure that agents, intermediaries, and other third parties acting on the Company’s behalf are properly vetted to minimize the risk of non-compliance with this Policy.  The Company’s Legal Team can direct you to individuals who can assist in performing this due diligence.

# 7\.          	Violations, Enforcement, and Penalties

## Failure to comply with Anti-Corruption or AML Laws may result in serious civil, criminal, and administrative penalties.  Individuals may also be subject to severe penalties, including substantial fines and, in the case of knowing violations, imprisonment.  The Company will not tolerate violations of law or this Policy by personnel or any third party acting on the Company’s behalf.  Violations will be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination.

# 8\.          	Seeking Guidance on This Policy

Company personnel with questions about Anti-Corruption or AML Laws or the requirements of this Policy are obligated to seek guidance by contacting the Legal Team at legal@uniswap.

## OFAC Sanctions and Trade Compliance Program 

OFAC administers and enforces U.S. economic and trade sanctions programs against specific comprehensively sanctioned jurisdictions (listed above), as well as targeted foreign governments, individuals, groups, economic sectors, and entities around the world in accordance with national security and foreign policy goals and objectives. While many of the listed prohibited parties are concentrated in jurisdictions of known concern to the U.S. Government (such as Russia, Belarus, China, and Venezuela), there are some parties resident in almost all countries in the world who appear on the “blacklist” (formally the “Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List” or the “SDN List”), which is managed and principally enforced by OFAC.  
   
OFAC has an important law enforcement and national security function working to leverage and protect U.S. global power through its work on counter-terrorism, anti-money laundering, and sanctions. OFAC and the broader Treasury Department – including its sister agency, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Center (FinCEN) – closely scrutinize new technologies or entities that could threaten American national security through failure to comply with its regulations. Similarly, potential partners or mainstream investors in Uniswap will avoid the company if we do not have a Sanctions and Trade Compliance Program (STCP) to appropriately address our compliance risk profile.

   
Finally, in addition to corporate regulatory risk, our employees face personal risk if they are found to facilitate financing for terrorists or rogue regimes or otherwise act in violation of OFAC regulations. Entities and individuals who the U.S. Government deems to have violated these regulations – by impermissibly undertaking or facilitating transactions with blocked entities or jurisdictions – face significant civil and criminal liabilities, including the potential for substantial fines and, if violations are deemed serious enough, even incarceration. Importantly, individuals and companies can face civil consequences (fines) under a strict liability theory – violative actions do not need to be significant *nor purposeful* in order to be subjected to regulatory consequences.

   
OFAC expects companies involved with digital assets, such as Uniswap, to adopt a “risk-based” approach to compliance. See [OFAC Sanctions Compliance Guidance for the Virtual Currency Industry](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/virtual_currency_guidance_brochure.pdf).  As such, our approach to compliance should take into account our business model, as well as what we understand to be the fast-changing regulatory environment.  
   
OFAC’s “risk-based” expectation means that there is no one-size-fits all approach to complying with the agency’s regulations (and related FinCEN regulations and export restrictions administered by the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)). Rather, OFAC encourages an organization subject to U.S. jurisdiction, such as Uniswap, to employ a “risk-based approach to sanctions compliance” by developing, implementing, and routinely updating its STCP. According to OFAC’s Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), a risk-based approach for compliance in the cryptocurrency arena is similar to one for fiat currency. Indeed, OFAC’s limited guidance on cryptocurrency suggests that the obligations for entities dealing with cryptocurrency are identical to those dealing with fiat currency. In fact, OFAC jurisdiction is not triggered by the exchange of currency – but rather by the undertaking of any dealing in which anything of value (including a service) is provided to, by, or through a counterparty. Generally, if a counterparty is restricted (due to their location in a comprehensively sanctioned jurisdiction or presence on the SDN List), any undertaking with it is prohibited regardless the means, mechanism or denomination of the exchange. If there is a violation, OFAC will consider as an important mitigation in its assessment of appropriate enforcement actions if an alleged violator had an appropriate STCP at the time of the apparent violation. Uniswap therefore analyzes the risks of sanctions violations below and has tailored its sanctions compliance program in keeping with those risks and OFAC’s approach to enforcement.  
   
Because Uniswap deals with novel financial products on which OFAC and other agencies have been concentrating, our risks are somewhat elevated (compared with an offline enterprise for example). According to [OFAC guidance](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/framework_ofac_cc.pdf) released in May 2019, companies should consider the risks of “using the U.S. financial system” or “processing payments” for OFAC-sanctioned entities, individuals and jurisdictions. While Uniswap is not formally part of the traditional financial system nor does it *generally* process payments, it does permit the exchange of value between parties unrelated to Uniswap. Consequently, that is the key risk that needs to be addressed and managed via the STCP.  
   
Uniswap’s risk across the Protocol, the Token, and the Interface differ and consequently the STCP provides that appropriate risk-based compliance is also different across these products.  
   
1\. 	On the Protocol, we should be willing to provide proactive education to law enforcement and policy makers and to direct such law enforcement and policy makers to blockchain analytics consultants and experts or engage a consultant directly to help with reactive technical diligence.  
   
2\. 	On the Token, when we are involved in token transactions, such as directly paying someone in tokens, Uniswap should engage in appropriate risk-based measures including, as necessary, adhering to the Uniswap Policy on Compliance with Anti-Corruption and Anti-Money Laundering Laws.  
   
3\. 	On the Interface we should:  
a. geo-block all jurisdictions subject to comprehensive sanctions.  
b. block all Ethereum addresses on the SDN List and file necessary reports to OFAC  if these addresses attempt to trade on the Interface.  
c. continue to work with TRM Labs or others in the industry, to be able to respond to suspicious behavior identified on the Interface.  
   
As noted, the Protocol, the Token, and Interface differ and different risk-based compliance is called for each offering. (One commonality between them is that none involves the sort of encryption requiring notice to the government authorities like the National Security Agency and BIS—there’s no encryption in the token or smart contract, as all the encryption is published in Ethereum.)  
   
**Protocol Compliance**  
With respect to the Protocol, it is “publicly available” much like Linux and therefore our obligations are very limited. By definition, such software is “available for download \[or use\] without restriction.” The Protocol is an immutable code and we cannot block transactions or approve them. The relationship between Uniswap (or Universal Navigation, Inc.) and the Uniswap Protocol is similar to the relationships between (a) Vint Cerf and the Internet Protocol; (b) Tim Berners-Lee and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol; (c) Satoshi Nakamoto and the Bitcoin Protocol; (d) the Ethereum Foundation and the Ethereum protocol. As a general matter, none of these “inventors” control who uses the products they developed nor for what purpose. As a general matter, none of them is responsible for sanctions violations using their protocols. This remains true even though Bitcoin and Ethereum, like Uniswap, are financial protocols for transferring value. It remains the case even though both Satoshi and the Ethereum Foundation received compensation through retaining or early mining of protocol tokens.  
   
Even if our risk-based compliance obligations are limited with respect to the Protocol, we should be willing to proactively provide authorities with educational conversations and materials so that we can emphasize our commitment to compliance with the authorities and they, in turn, can gain a greater understanding of our operations and be able to address actors who are not taking their OFAC responsibilities seriously (including by providing Uniswap guidance, as needed, concerning appropriate compliance).

   
At the same time, even if the mechanics of our appropriately risk-based compliance obligations with respect to the Interface are limited, they exist and compliance with OFAC regulations remains critical. The Interface may be analogous to a simple website, but websites have compliance obligations. Vint Cerf works for Google; Google’s website complies with OFAC. Satoshi, as a non-U.S. person located outside of the United States, may not have co-direct compliance obligations with OFAC, but Coinbase, as a U.S. person, does. Open sourcing the Interface code does not change this requirement; WordPress is open source and websites using it must comply with OFAC. The IPFS/IPNS hosting does not change this calculus either, especially in light of our updating the codebase regularly and the pinning service. Indeed, such updating and pinning provides enough of a U.S. nexus that OFAC compliance obligations likely attach.  
   
**Token Compliance**  
Regarding the Token, when we are involved in Token transactions, such as directly paying someone in tokens, we must engage in appropriate risk-based measures including, as necessary, AML/KYC (including OFAC).  
   
**Interface Compliance**  
Interface compliance requires geo-blocking comprehensively sanctioned jurisdictions. If we do not block traders located in Iran on the Interface, for example, we could be seen as “facilitating” prohibited transactions or impermissibly exporting financial services to Iran. As of the date of this message, sanctioned jurisdictions are listed above in TL;DR. We must block access to any IP address in those jurisdictions. We have asked Cloudflare to block these regions. Cloudflare can discard the IP addresses after screening. (OFAC recognizes that users can employ VPNs and that geo-blocking is imperfect; however, perfection  is not the goal. Risk-based compliance measures are the key and geo-blocking is considered an industry standard and best practice). We utilize TRM Labs for assistance in blocking comprehensively sanctioned regions (rather than countries), such as Crimea. The Crimea sanctions have been in place for more than five years and as such there is significant best practices in the market as to how to appropriately geo-block the region.  Currently TRM is also actively investigating and monitoring the Russia-Ukraine conflict and its impact on sanctions. TRM tracks Russian extremist groups, for instance, with links to the DNR region and is collaborating with Ukrainian authorities to surface links between blockchain addresses and sanctioned persons, entities, and countries.  
   
Uniswap should block transactions involving any Ethereum addresses on the SDN List or otherwise connected to SDNs. These addresses are associated with sanctioned people. As of January 11, 2023, OFAC maintained 142 ETH addresses (2x duplicate addresses identified).  We should block them on the Uniswap Interface – and to the extent any party tries to transact with these addresses, the payment transfer must be blocked and reported to OFAC within 10 business days of the attempted transaction.

   
We use TRM Wallet Screening to screen addresses that connect to the Interface in order to detect ownership and counterparty risk exposure related to sanctioned addresses and entities. When any address connects to the Interface, we send that address to TRM’s API and TRM screens it based on a risk engine configured by Uniswap. TRM links addresses to sanctioned persons, sanctioned organizations, and entities in sanctioned jurisdictions.  The Trade Compliance Group or a law firm then uses the TRM data to assess the risks of identified addresses.  
   
TRM Labs checks for updates daily and helps ensure our blocking list is current.

## Conflict Resolution/Open Door Policy {#conflict-resolution/open-door-policy}

Uniswap Labs strives to provide a comfortable, productive, legal, and ethical work environment. To this end, we want team members to bring any problems, concerns, or grievances they have about the workplace to the attention of their manager and, if necessary, to the People team or upper level management. To help manage conflict resolution, we have instituted the following problem solving procedure: 

In the case where an employee believes there is inappropriate conduct or activity on the part of Uniswap Labs, management, its team members, vendors, customers, or any other persons or entities related to us, they should bring their concerns to PBP or the attention of their manager. Most problems can be resolved informally through dialogue between an employee and their immediate manager. 

If an employee has already brought a particular matter to the attention of their Manager before and does not believe they have received a sufficient response, or if they believe that person is the source of the problem, they can present their concerns to the PBP or upper level management. Team members should describe the problem, those persons involved in the problem, efforts that have been made to resolve the problem, and any suggested solutions.

## Leaving Uniswap Labs   {#leaving-uniswap-labs}

Ending Your Employment

Because we are an At-Will employer, you can choose to end your employment at any time. Should you choose to end your time at Uniswap Labs, we ask that you do so in writing and submit it to your Manager. Please do your best to give as much advance notice as possible. Should you be unable to give advance notice, arrangements will be made such that you receive your final paycheck.

Termination

Because we are an At-Will employer, the company can also generally choose to end your employment at any time. We value all of our team members, so it is our top priority to ensure the work environment is safe and productive for every team member at Uniswap Labs. To maintain this value, if any employee is found to be in violation of any of the outlined policies in this handbook, we reserve the ability to take disciplinary action up to and including immediate termination. We sincerely hope that none of our team members find themselves in this position, however if your position is terminated for any reason, arrangements will be made such that you receive your final paycheck.

Exit Interview

Upon leaving Uniswap Labs, you may be asked to participate in an Exit Interview conducted by the People Team that will help us better understand what your time at Uniswap Labs was like, your reason for ending your time with us and how we can improve for future team members. This is a necessary process for our growth as an organization, so we ask that you please be as cooperative as possible during this final task.

Treatment of Laptops: Returning your laptop  
At the time of offboarding, you must return your laptop to Uniswap Labs. Instructions will be provided to you on how to do this at the time of offboarding.

Post Employment References

We hope that the time that you had at Uniswap Labs was well spent, and you formed connections here that will help you towards the next phase of your career. Because of this, we permit the request of references (both character and professional) from your Manager. Please be aware, however, that they are free to decline any and all requests should they so choose. In this case, Uniswap Labs will only provide your former and most recent title, and dates of employment. In the case that written consent is given by you, we will also disclose your former salary and wage.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND AGREEMENT REGARDING THE UNISWAP LABS’S  
POLICY PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT, AND RETALIATION

This is to acknowledge that I have received a copy of the policy of Universal Navigation Inc., d/b/a Uniswap Labs (the “Uniswap Labs”)  prohibiting discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.  I have read and understand the Uniswap Labs’s policy that there be no discrimination or harassment against individuals on the basis of on race, color, national origin, citizenship, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, physical or mental disability, pregnancy, childbirth or related medical condition, protected military service or veteran status, genetic information, taking or requesting statutorily protected leave or any other legally-protected status under applicable law (“Protected Categories”), which in New York State and/or New York City, also includes traits historically associated with race (including but not limited to hair texture and protective hairstyles), creed, ancestry, alienage, familial or marital status, partnership status, caregiver status, gender, gender expression, the employee’s or the employee’s dependent’s reproductive health decision making (including but not limited to a decision to use or access a particular drug, device or medical service), status as a victim of domestic violence, sex offenses or stalking, engaging in certain lawful off-duty and off-site legally protected recreational activities, and, in certain circumstances, unemployment status, credit history, salary history and arrest and conviction history.

I understand that Uniswap Labs is committed to a work environment free of harassment and discrimination, and that Uniswap Labs specifically prohibits retaliation whenever an individual makes a good-faith complaint that he or she has been subjected to harassment or discrimination.  Accordingly, I understand that if I am subjected to or witness any conduct which I view to constitute harassment, discrimination, or retaliation or any other violation of the Uniswap Labs’s policy prohibiting discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, I am encouraged to promptly report such conduct to my manager or a member of the People Operations team.

I understand that nothing in these policies is intended in any way to create a contract of employment and that, unless I have a formal written employment agreement entered into for this purpose signed by both me and a member of the executive team, I am employed at will and this policy does not modify my at-will status.
