## Leaves

Uniswap has partnered with [Cocoon](https://app.cocoon.com/uniswaplabs) to assist with your Leave of Absence planning.

Common leave types & our processes:

- Parental Leave
    
    
    We‚Äôve partnered with [Cocoon](https://app.cocoon.com/uniswaplabs) to make your leave process as smooth as possible! Create your confidential Cocoon account [here](https://app.cocoon.com/uniswaplabs).
    
    Have questions about your family planning journey? Take advantage of our [Maven](https://www.mavenclinic.com/) benefit offering which provides support and guidance on navigating fertility, pregnancy, birth, or adoption. Reach out to @Julian Sanchez with questions! 
    
    ### Process:
    
    1. Create your [Maven](https://www.mavenclinic.com/) account for new parent advice and your confidential [Cocoon](https://app.cocoon.com/uniswaplabs) account and input your leave details to see what your leave and pay will look like. Don‚Äôt submit the plan in Cocoon if you‚Äôre not ready to share as this notifies us!
    2. Notify People Business Partner (PBP = Megan) of the need for your leave noting the expected start date, length of leave, if you will be taking it intermittently or all at once.
        - Non-birthing/Paternity leave: 12 weeks, paid at 100% of your salary
        - Birthing/Maternity leave: 16 weeks, paid at 100% of your salary
        
        *In a state with a parental leave fund?* We‚Äôll supplement your wages with those $üí∏$üí∏ to get you to that üíØ%
        
    3. Your PBP and you will meet with People Ops (@Julian Sanchez) to discuss this process in detail, outline filing your claim with Cocoon, and answer any questions you may have.
    4. Once your leave begins, your status will change in Sequoia to LOAP (leave of absence, protected) and you will continue to be paid as normal, on a semi-monthly basis.
    5. When your leave period is over and you are set to return to work, let @Megan know and we will process your ‚Äúreturn from leave‚Äù in Sequoia.
    
    - **Leave planning with Cocoon**
        - Cocoon has a built in leave planning tool to outline all the details you need to know. You can use this tool confidentially as Uniswap is not notified until you submit your formal leave plan request in the Cocoon portal. Taking a step back‚Ä¶how do you do that?
            1. Create your account with [Cocoon](https://app.cocoon.com/uniswaplabs) and ensure all of your personal information is correct. This data is the same as what we have in Sequoia. If anything is inaccurate please also let @Julian Sanchez know so we can update.
            2. Plan and explore your leave option in the Cocoon Leave Planning tool. You‚Äôll be able to see how much time and pay to expect based on federal, state, and company laws and policies. Cocoon has created a video [here](https://www.loom.com/share/b22d782520ad4c55aac2ffbc4b433b0f?sid=d4b2f0a1-886b-4f3c-88d3-8442c0435bf0) to help guide you!
            3. When you‚Äôre ready, submit your leave plan to notify Uniswap you have completed this process. [Here](https://support.cocoon.com/en/articles/6241711-what-employees-see-after-planning-a-leave) is an overview of what you will see after you‚Äôve planned your leave.
                - Need to make changes to your leave plan? You can do so following the steps outlined [here](https://support.cocoon.com/en/articles/8404446-leave-date-changes)!
            
    - **Filing your claim with Cocoon**
        - Now that your leave plan is submitted in Cocoon, you‚Äôll see the breakdown of your pay and the claims that you need to file once your new child arrives. The types of claims you‚Äôll need to file depend on if you are the birthing parent and the state that you reside within. Specific state overviews can be found [here](https://support.cocoon.com/en/collections/4911560-state-experiences) but regardless of the state, you will need a copy of the child's birth certificate or adoptive child‚Äôs placement documentation.
        - There are two ways that Cocoon helps you file claims:
        1. Cocoon will file the claim directly with the insurance carrier.
            - **NYers**, this will be your process. Cocoon will pre-populate the forms for you, have you confirm information and upload necessary documents. Once all they info they need is compiled, Cocoon will file the claim for you directly.
        2. Cocoon will present you with a ‚ÄúClaims Co-Pilot‚Äù tool.
            - **CA peeps**, this is for you. CA residents need to complete an identity verification process through [ID.me](http://id.me/), and CA EDD representatives will only release claim information to the benefit recipient directly.
            - Cocoon has created ‚ÄúClaims Co-Pilot‚Äù tool to make this process as easy as they can for you. The tool will show pre-populated forms from Cocoon that in another window, you will copy the information over to your personal CA EDD portal to file the claim. Curious what this looks like? Check out [this video](https://www.loom.com/share/70cc642903f7402cadc9ad3354e5d7f9?sid=c6f59e21-1734-4833-ac6f-ac420494c608).
        - Boom! Your claims have been submitted and once processed, you‚Äôll start receiving your state payments and top off payments from Uniswap.
    - **Adding your child to your insurance**
        
        Submit a Qualifying Life Event in Sequoia using the guide below - This must be completed within¬†**30 days**¬†of the child‚Äôs birth or placement.

    - **Parental Leave FAQs**
        - When should I let Uniswap Labs know I need parental leave?
            - Whenever you feel comfortable sharing with us! We ask that you let us know no later than 30 days before your leave would start so we can plan, share logistics, and support you with coverage planning.
        - Who do I need to notify of my need for parental leave?
            - We encourage you to share with anyone you feel comfortable doing so, especially with your direct manager. However, ultimately, your PBP and People Ops are the only ones who need to know in order to process your leave.
        - If I have concerns about telling people or about leaves who do I talk to?
            - Reach out to your PBP to help navigate these conversations or to People Ops about the process surrounding leaves.
        - I‚Äôm a manager, is anything different for me?
            - There is no difference in the way that Uniswap Labs processes leaves for managers vs ICs. As a manager, you will work more closely with your PBP to create a coverage plan while you are on your leave.
        - Do I have to take my leave all at once?
            - Nope! You can take your leave intermittently. However, we ask that you do so as a minimum of two week increments.
        - Who decides how much time I take off?
            - Ultimately, your health care provider determines how much time you need to take off. If you need more time than the Uniswap Labs paid parental leave allows for, you will be able to continue to take leave, but it will be unpaid.
        - Do I need to file with my state?
            - Yep! As a resident of your state that offers paid family leave, you have a deduction on your pay stub that contributes to this fund. Filing with the state allow you to benefit from the funds you contributed üÜí Uniswap Labs uses these funds to process your top off payment to get you to your 100% salary.
        - What happens to my equity and token vesting while on parental leave?
            - As long as you remain employed by Uniswap Labs your tokens and equity will continue to vest in accordance to your agreements. Your parental leave does not impact this üòé
        - What happens to my benefits while on parental leave?
            - Your benefits remain active while on leave. When your child arrives, you will need to submit a qualifying life event (QLE) to add them to your insurance. At this point, you will also be able to change your health plans if you would like. Heads up that the only other time you can do this is during the annual open enrollment period.
        - Is parental leave a protected type of leave?
            - Yes, parental leaves are protected.
        - Do I need to make a coverage plan for while I am on leave?
            - Yep! Your PBP and manager will help with the creation of this to best support your team and allow you to focus on your new family member.
        - What if someone reaches out to me while I am on leave?
            - We ask that you change your slack status as OOO and add in an OOO reply to your email. This + a coverage plan, should help minimize this from occurring so you can focus on your new family member.
        - What should I do when it is time to return from leave?
            - As your return from leave date approaches, be in touch with @Sabrina Rossi. If anything changes on your end (i.e. coming back early or needing more time) we‚Äôll talk through your options.
            - ***No changes?*** On your first day back to work let @Sabrina Rossi know so your status in Sequoia can be changed as returned from leave.
        - What is considered a qualifying life event for insurance?
            - A change in your situation ‚Äî like getting married, having a baby, or losing health coverage ‚Äî  can make you eligible for a Special Enrollment Period, allowing you to enroll in health insurance outside the yearly Open Enrollment Period.
        - Who do I talk to about SDI issues?
            - You‚Äôll need to reach out to your state directly if you are experiencing any issues to your PFL or DI issues.
                - [California](https://edd.ca.gov/en/about_edd/contact_edd)
                - [New York](https://paidfamilyleave.ny.gov/) - ¬†[(844) 337-6303](tel:(844) 337-6303)
        - How do top off payments work?
            - If you are eligible for a paid state leave fund, you‚Äôll follow the below process:
                1. File your claim with the state.
                2. When you receive your first payment or summary of benefits, share that with @Julian Sanchez  to show the amount of state funds you received.
                    1. There may be a weeklong waiting period depending on your state. Your funds will come through after this has passed.
                3. @Julian Sanchez  will forward this over to the Sequoia payroll team to then calculate the remaining amount owed to make you whole at 100% of your salary.
                4. Repeat this process until you exhaust your state leave benefits. After which point, if applicable, you will be paid for at 100% by Uniswap Labs.
        - When do I need to submit my paperwork by?
            - For state leaves, the deadline to submit paperwork varies based on the state you live in.
                - CA - 41 days after your child arrives.
                - NY - 30 days after your child arrives.
            - For qualifying life event paperwork, you have 30 days after the event occurs. In this case, 30 days after your child arrives.
        - Do I fill out state paperwork or does the company?
            - You will need to complete all of the employee sections of the state paperwork. We‚Äôre only able to complete the employer sections **after** your employee sections are submitted.
            
- Unpaid Leave of Absences
    
    
    **TL;DR** a personal unpaid leave of absence may be used for team members who need to step away from work in order to focus on a personal life event or activity.
    
    - What are the reasons I‚Äôd take a personal unpaid leave of absence?
        
        These are some ideas we have, but this certainly does not include all the possibilities:
        
        1. A short-term development opportunity such as an apprenticeship, code school, educational institution, certification program, trade school, etc üß†
        2. Volunteer or community service program that requires full-time focus üíö
        3. Personal or family care not otherwise protected under state or federal law (or where protected time does not extend long enough to cover the time needed) üë™
        
        Whatever the reason, we offer a maximum of 6 weeks for an unpaid LOA.
        
    - How do I take a personal unpaid leave of absence?
        1. Request the leave (in writing üìù¬†pls!) to your Manager and PBP with the purpose, duration and start date
        2. Your manager and PBP will review the request, eligibility, and business needs üíº
            - If not approved, your manager will let you know ASAP
        3. Manager & PBP will give their +1 and elevate to the relevant Executive team member & VP of People for final ‚ûï1Ô∏è‚É£
            - I+1s all around? Your manager will let you know and your PBP will send a confirmation email with next steps, template transition plan, and notes on benefits if applicable üíû
        4. ***Leave time up?*** You‚Äôll need to return on time üïê and work with your manager to get back up to speed ‚ö°
    - How am I eligible for taking an Unpaid LOA like this?
        1. Working with Uniswap full-time for a minimum of 6 months üóìÔ∏è
        2. Performance is up to expectations üëç
        3. The leave has been requested a quarter in advance ‚è©
            
            ***If the leave is unplanned/urgent, requesting with a shorter notice may still be approved.*
            
    - What else do I need to know?
        
        Ok ok the logistical stuff now‚Ä¶
        
        - **Benefit payments:**
            - You‚Äôll be responsible for your benefit premiums, 401(k) withdrawals, commuter benefit deductions, and mandatory payroll deductions while on leave.
            - Heads up! These will be processed as a lump sum payment üí∞ deducted from your first paycheck upon returning from your leave.
                - We understand this could cause a hardship, if this is the case let your PBP know and we‚Äôll work to find a resolution üíñ
        - **Work Coverage:**
            - The work‚Äôs still gotta get done! We‚Äôll need you to work with your manager to pass on outstanding work before you head out. We‚Äôve tried to make this easy for you and have created a [template here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1djC8_P0E2BU2PjRPaFVfmfogm4rDJNSFPw4rqqLcKWg/edit?usp=sharing) üìÉ
        - **Returning to work:**
            - You‚Äôll need to work closely with your manager and People Ops the week prior to returning for planning ‚Ü©Ô∏è
        - **Extensions:**
            - We won‚Äôt be able to extend your unpaid LOA without exceptional circumstances üòø Should something exceptional arise, reach out to your manager and People Business Partner ASAP
        - **Stacking:**
            - Sorry friends, you‚Äôre not able to stack an unpaid leave with another type of leave of absence ‚úñÔ∏è
        - **Role on return:**
            - We can‚Äôt promise that you will be able to return to the same role or team. We‚Äôll do everything we can, but the business needs to carry on while you are out ü§å
    
    **FAQs:**
    
    - Is this the same as PTO?
        - Nope. Flexible time off is generally taken in increments of one day to two weeks for reasons such as vacations or general recharging of your batteries üå¥
    - Is this a sabbatical?
        - Nope üëé Uniswap does not have a sabbatical program. Although unpaid leaves and sabbaticals are both a form of time off, a sabbatical is taken after someone has significant tenure (3-4+ years) and you continue to be paid your regular salary. A personal leave of absence is unpaid and does not require significant tenure.
    - Can I use this to take time off and travel for 6 weeks?
        - If your travels would go over ~2 weeks at a time, pls work with your manager to understand your options for nomadic remote work. An unpaid leave is not intended to be used for general travel üôÖ

    *Something else in mind?* Talk to @Julian Sanchez from the People Ops team and we‚Äôll see what home office magic can happen üí´
    
    **How do I get these funds?**
    
    We make it easy for you. We will issue you a ramp card with a $2,000 limit and make all purchases using it. Once you max out that card, you‚Äôve maxed out your allowance.
    
    **What else do I need to know?**
    
    This is a one time offering and additional funds won‚Äôt be available so spend üí∞¬†wisely! If you do need something in particular or if a piece of your tech broke, let us know and we can talk about an additional reimbursement even if you already used this allowance in full.
    
    ***Have Questions?*** The People team is here to help!
    
- Team Events
    
    
    We üíì¬†team time here at Uniswap. So much so, we have a budget for each team to bond and connect outside of the normal day-to-day. Any event that promotes team bonding, learning, and/or productivity ‚Äî and aligns with our values ‚Äî is encouraged ‚≠ê.
    
    All the info you need to know on using this budget can be found below üëá. If you have any questions about the process or how the budget works, reach out to @Julian Sanchez or @Megan!
    
    ***What‚Äôs the high level process?***
    
    1. Team leads, or someone they delegate, should reach out to @Julian Sanchez or @Megan to kick things off. People Ops will then let you know what budget you have available to you and can provide recommendations. 
        - The budget is the same regardless of the team you work on = ***$75/person each quarter.***
    2. Teams will be responsible for planning and sharing the logistics with everyone attending. If the event allows for prepayment, People Ops can process the payment with our Ramp card.
        - If the event requires payment at the time of the event, such as a dinner, the team lead should either use one of their Ramp cards or expense it.
    3. After the event, the team lead will share the final costs and number of attendees with People Ops for tracking.
    4. Have a blast with the team!
    
    **Frequently Asked Questions**
    
    - What kinds of events can we plan?
        
        Events can be anything you can think of! Similar to our NYC office events, these can be dinners, activities, shows, whatever your idea is we‚Äôll try to make it happen with you. Just don‚Äôt forget to run your idea by @Julian Sanchez or @Megan before booking.
        
    - Why can we only do one event per quarter?
        
        We have a limited budget for these so we ask that each team only plans one gathering per quarter so each team can use their budget.
        
    - Do these events have to be in person or can we do something with remote peeps too?
        
        These events can absolutely be hybrid and include remote team members! Unfortunately, the budget is not big enough to allow for travel for them to attend the events.
        
        However, if they are utilizing their [NYC Visits](https://www.notion.so/NYC-Visits-ac380e0cf04f4101bfdb207cf6bbd801?pvs=21) budget and are in town, now that‚Äôs a great time to plan a team event.
        
    - Why is the budget per person?
        
        We calculate all of event budgets at the per person cost to make sure that we have everyone fully covered and teams both big and small, can do events they want to do.
        
    - Do our events need to include everyone on the team?
        
        Team events are meant to be inclusive and an opportunity for the whole team to bond together. This means that yes, everyone needs to be invited.
        
    - If someone can‚Äôt attend, does that mean we can still use their budget?
        
        Unfortunately, the budget is based off of those who are attending the events. This means that if only 5 of the 7 people on your team can attend, you only have the budget for 5 people. 
        
        However, if someone can‚Äôt make it last minute, that will be covered under your budget.
        
    - Can our budget roll over from quarter to quarter?
        
        You can rollover one quarters worth of budget to the next but all budget resets each year. Our hope with this is that you do actually use your funds!
        
    - Does our budget increase if we hire someone new during the year?
        
        We set the budgets at the beginning of each year in accordance with our expected headcount/hiring plan for the year so these budgets already include these new hires!
        
    - Why does the budget for events sit with the People Ops team?
        
        The budget sits with People Ops for tracking purposes. The team takes note of the costs incurred, attendees, and can even support you with planning your events!
        
    - Will execs get a report out on what we use our budget for?
        
        Yep! Execs will receive a quarterly update on which teams used their budget, for what, and how much of it so they can encourage you to keep spending quality time with your team!

    - why: midway betweeen all-UL onsites to avoid too-close-together travel
    - what if we don‚Äôt like this week: plan with your cross-functional peers & DM @Megan
    </aside>
    
    ### **What are team onsites?**
    
    Onsites are a great way to talk big picture, kick off or work on projects, bond, and learn from each other. We ‚ù§Ô∏è¬†team time and believe coming together annually will help you accomplish incredible work. Bonus - you‚Äôll get to spend more time in our fabulous office.
    
    ### **How do we plan onsites?**
    
    1. Complete the [request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1VsG-m-OOY9Ce5I6kGJnMGuwpB-IZXJzp11_RrmZCfxM/edit) with your goals and wait for confirmation from the People Team - you‚Äôll hear from either @Megan or @Julian Sanchez  üëã
    2. We‚Äôll set up some time to chat with you about your goals, outline how it works and budget stuff, and answer any questions you may have 
    3. Follow our guidelines and have a blast together üéä
    
    ## Onsite Guidelines:
    
    - (see above pilot callout) Onsites should be planned 6 weeks before they are set to take place. Ty for planning üôè
    - Uniswap covers one onsite for teams annually. Onsites are based off your teams, not pods.
    - Onsites & associated travel should in totality be no more than one week
    - Onsites need to have a purpose. Your chill and vibe time together will happen naturally üíó
    - All onsites will take place in our NYC HQ üçé
        - ***Why?*** We have a sweet office and with our limited budget for onsites, this is our best bet
    - Our [Experiences & Expenses guidelines](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z17u-ayvDWvL1uzJZcF93uveWL9fyw_s/view) still apply for onsites. Check those out if you‚Äôre unfamiliar with them üòé
    
    ### FAQs
    
    - Can we stay in an airbnb?
        
        Nope. We ask that you stay in hotels for everyone‚Äôs comfort and safety. Hotels will allow everyone to have their own rooms and space and offer an extra layer of safety that airbnbs don‚Äôt. 
        
        We recommend that everyone traveling for your offsite stays at the same hotel - we‚Äôre happy to help set up room blocks if you‚Äôre a large team!
        
    - What is the budget that we have for onsites?
        - Flights & Hotels for non-NYC locals booked through [Navan](http://navan.com) and within policy
        - One team dinner up to $60/person for the length of the offsite
        - Want to do something not noted here? Chat with @Julian Sanchez
    - Ok got it that our onsite has to be in NYC, can we airbnb there?
        
        Sorry, friend. Nope. The answer to the above question applies here too.
        
    - Do we have to focus on work during the onsite?
        
        Your offsite time can be used for a variety of work reasons. We ask that you have a genuine goal to accomplish with your gathering. Chill and vibe time will happen naturally, but isn‚Äôt the goal here
        
    - How do team dinners work with the meal stipend?
        
        All team dinners need to be in line with our expense guidelines. You can check those guidelines out [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z17u-ayvDWvL1uzJZcF93uveWL9fyw_s/view). 
        
    - What if we stay in the budget, then can we do our own thing?
        
        As long as you‚Äôre within budget and these guidelines, NYC is your playground. The workplace experience team can help with some recommended activities and restaurants. 
        
    - If we live in NYC can we get hotel rooms too?
        
        If you live in NYC already, you live in the greatest city! So, no, you will not be able to get hotel rooms. 
        
    - The office isn't "off" site, can we rent a space?
        
        Sadly üòû¬†no. We have a limited budget for this program and space rentals are expensive. We have invested lots of time and $$$ for our fabulous office and want you to take advantage of it!
        
    - Is there an annual budget for onsites?
        
        Yep! We have an annual budget and if it‚Äôs exceeded for the year early on, we sadly will decline further requests. Budgets are based on per head attending so we‚Äôll work with you on how much you‚Äôll have available to you. Please be mindful of spending so that all unicorns ü¶Ñ can partake in this offering!
        
    - What if our team is all on the west coast?
        
        Let‚Äôs talk about this one! It may make more sense, and be more cost effective, to make an exception to our NYC only guideline. 
        
- NYC Visits
    
    
    So you wanna come work with the NYC team? We don‚Äôt blame you, our office is sweet and in person team collaboration is invaluable. Before you do, check out the below info for the helpful deets you need to know including how often and how long you can. 
    
    If you‚Äôre planning a visit that isn‚Äôt addressed by these FAQs, we‚Äôre hear to chat and make magic happen when possible.
    
    ***How do I visit?***
    
    1. Chat with your manager on if it would be beneficial for you and the team and align on dates that work. You can visit NYC a max of 4 times a year, including our bi-annual onsites.
    2. Give @Julian Sanchez  a heads up that you‚Äôre planning a trip and they‚Äôll make sure your team has enough budget for your trip and let you know what desk will be reserved for you.
    3. Once you get +1 from People Ops, book your travel in Navan in accordance with the Experiences & Expense policy. A heads up given our limited budget, we can only cover a max of 5 nights in a hotel.
    4. When you‚Äôre traveling, use your Navan card for all expenses incurred on work travel.
    
    **Frequently Asked Questions**
    
    - Why can I only come once a quarter including onsites?
        
        We have set budgets for teams based on the number of expected travelers. Keeping visits to once a quarter including onsites allows us to make sure everyone can travel when needed.
        
    - How long can I stay when I visit?
        
        Uniswap will cover the costs for a maximum of five hotel nights within budget. If you are traveling during a week where hotel costs are over budget, you may be asked to stay for a shorter period of time or come another week.
        
    - Can I stay longer if I stay with friends or family?
        
        Sure can! In this case you are welcome to stay as long as you would like but your meals will only be covered for up to five days.
        
    - What if there is a business need for me to visit more frequently?
        
        If there is a business need approved by your team lead and executive, then you can visit more frequently but your travel costs will still be tracked within the overall budget.
        
    - Who tracks the budget spend for these visits?
        
        The People Operations team tracks the budget spend for these visits as the owner of the Navan system. This includes the cost tracking for your hotel, flights, and charges put on your Navan credit card while traveling.
        
    - Do I need to have a reason to visit?
        
        We ask that you have a reason to visit NYC if you are choosing a particular week to come. If you do not have a business need, and the timing selected is a peak time with higher travel costs, we may ask you to select a different week to travel in.
        
    - Does a team or company onsite count towards my visit?
        
        Yes, these would count towards your visits. You can discuss with your manager and People Ops if it makes sense for you to come early or stay late after these. 
        
    - If I‚Äôm an international employee, are my visits restricted to the same time length?
        
        You can discuss this with your manager and the People Ops team. The ultimate answer to this depends on available budget and costs during the timeframe you are planning on coming.
        
- Relocations
    
    
    So you wanna pack up and move to NYC? We don‚Äôt blame you, it‚Äôs awesome here. Before you do, check out the below info. If your role falls into the guidelines below, we‚Äôll provide you with an $8,000 pre-tax stipend for you to come work with us at HQ - no reimbursement requests needed. Questions about this process or if your role qualifies? Reach out to @Julian Sanchez .
    
    **Okay, but how?**
    
    - **New Hires**
        - When you were hired, was it clear that you needed to relocate for your new role? If yes, that should be outlined in your offer letter. Feel free to check it if you‚Äôre not sure.
        - Nothing noted in your offer letter but you still want to move? Check out the section below ‚Äî note that moves are only covered if there is a true business need.
    - **Current Team Members**
        1. Talk with your manager and your executive team member about whether it would benefit Uniswap to have your role based out of our NYC HQ. Typically, these are leadership roles or roles on the Product, Eng, and Design teams.
        2. If your manager and executive are aligned, reach out to @Julian Sanchez to receive approval from the Finance and People Ops team. 
        3. If approved, let Finance & People Ops know your expected move timeline. Something change? All good! We‚Äôll check in 2 weeks before what you shared initially.
        4. After you officially move, welcome to New York! People Ops will send you an official change of location note and outline how to update your new address in Sequoia. Make sure to do that ASAP so your taxes aren't impacted!
        5. Within 30 days of your move, we‚Äôll add the $8,000 stipend to your paycheck.
            1. This will be treated as a bonus from a tax perspective and will be required to be paid back to the company if you leave within one year of the issuance date.
    
    **Frequently Asked Questions**
    
    - Is the stipend subject to taxes?
        - Yes, the stipend is subject to all taxes. The stipend is viewed as a bonus and taxed in accordance to IRS regulations.
    - Can I get the stipend before my move?
        - No. The stipends are only able to be issued after your move has been completed.
    - What happens if I leave the company before I reach my one year mark?
        - Under the terms of your relocation stipend issuance, you will be required to repay the company the funds issued to you. We‚Äôll let you know how to do this if this comes up.
    - What if I recently moved to NYC and did not receive a stipend?
        - Relocation stipends are not issued retroactively. We know NYC is sweet, but we will only issue stipends for those who have a business need, not just because you want to live here.
    - When can I expect the stipend payment to be issued?
        - We‚Äôll do our best to get this out to you as soon as we can after your move has taken place. It will arrive within 1-2 paychecks after you move.
    - If I am an intern/fellow being converted to full time, am I eligible?
        
        Yes! This will be noted in your offer letter to join us full time.
