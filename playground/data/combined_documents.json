        "content": "## Leaves\n\nUniswap has partnered with [Cocoon](https://app.cocoon.com/uniswaplabs) to assist with your Leave of Absence planning.\n\nCommon leave types & our processes:\n\n- Parental Leave\n    \n    \n    We\u2019ve partnered with [Cocoon](https://app.cocoon.com/uniswaplabs) to make your leave process as smooth as possible! Create your confidential Cocoon account [here](https://app.cocoon.com/uniswaplabs).\n    \n    Have questions about your family planning journey? Take advantage of our [Maven](https://www.mavenclinic.com/) benefit offering which provides support and guidance on navigating fertility, pregnancy, birth, or adoption. Reach out to @Julian Sanchez with questions! \n    \n    ### Process:\n    \n    1. Create your [Maven](https://www.mavenclinic.com/) account for new parent advice and your confidential [Cocoon](https://app.cocoon.com/uniswaplabs) account and input your leave details to see what your leave and pay will look like. Don\u2019t submit the plan in Cocoon if you\u2019re not ready to share as this notifies us!\n    2. Notify People Business Partner (PBP = Megan) of the need for your leave noting the expected start date, length of leave, if you will be taking it intermittently or all at once.\n        - Non-birthing/Paternity leave: 12 weeks, paid at 100% of your salary\n        - Birthing/Maternity leave: 16 weeks, paid at 100% of your salary\n        \n        *In a state with a parental leave fund?* We\u2019ll supplement your wages with those $\ud83d\udcb8$\ud83d\udcb8 to get you to that \ud83d\udcaf%\n        \n    3. Your PBP and you will meet with People Ops (@Julian Sanchez) to discuss this process in detail, outline filing your claim with Cocoon, and answer any questions you may have.\n    4. Once your leave begins, your status will change in Sequoia to LOAP (leave of absence, protected) and you will continue to be paid as normal, on a semi-monthly basis.\n    5. When your leave period is over and you are set to return to work, let @Megan know and we will process your \u201creturn from leave\u201d in Sequoia.\n    \n    - **Leave planning with Cocoon**\n        - Cocoon has a built in leave planning tool to outline all the details you need to know. You can use this tool confidentially as Uniswap is not notified until you submit your formal leave plan request in the Cocoon portal. Taking a step back\u2026how do you do that?\n            1. Create your account with [Cocoon](https://app.cocoon.com/uniswaplabs) and ensure all of your personal information is correct. This data is the same as what we have in Sequoia. If anything is inaccurate please also let @Julian Sanchez know so we can update.\n            2. Plan and explore your leave option in the Cocoon Leave Planning tool. You\u2019ll be able to see how much time and pay to expect based on federal, state, and company laws and policies. Cocoon has created a video [here](https://www.loom.com/share/b22d782520ad4c55aac2ffbc4b433b0f?sid=d4b2f0a1-886b-4f3c-88d3-8442c0435bf0) to help guide you!\n            3. When you\u2019re ready, submit your leave plan to notify Uniswap you have completed this process. [Here](https://support.cocoon.com/en/articles/6241711-what-employees-see-after-planning-a-leave) is an overview of what you will see after you\u2019ve planned your leave.\n                - Need to make changes to your leave plan? You can do so following the steps outlined [here](https://support.cocoon.com/en/articles/8404446-leave-date-changes)!\n            \n    - **Filing your claim with Cocoon**\n        - Now that your leave plan is submitted in Cocoon, you\u2019ll see the breakdown of your pay and the claims that you need to file once your new child arrives. The types of claims you\u2019ll need to file depend on if you are the birthing parent and the state that you reside within. Specific state overviews can be found [here](https://support.cocoon.com/en/collections/4911560-state-experiences) but regardless of the state, you will need a copy of the child's birth certificate or adoptive child\u2019s placement documentation.\n        - There are two ways that Cocoon helps you file claims:\n        1. Cocoon will file the claim directly with the insurance carrier.\n            - **NYers**, this will be your process. Cocoon will pre-populate the forms for you, have you confirm information and upload necessary documents. Once all they info they need is compiled, Cocoon will file the claim for you directly.\n        2. Cocoon will present you with a \u201cClaims Co-Pilot\u201d tool.\n            - **CA peeps**, this is for you. CA residents need to complete an identity verification process through [ID.me](http://id.me/), and CA EDD representatives will only release claim information to the benefit recipient directly.\n            - Cocoon has created \u201cClaims Co-Pilot\u201d tool to make this process as easy as they can for you. The tool will show pre-populated forms from Cocoon that in another window, you will copy the information over to your personal CA EDD portal to file the claim. Curious what this looks like? Check out [this video](https://www.loom.com/share/70cc642903f7402cadc9ad3354e5d7f9?sid=c6f59e21-1734-4833-ac6f-ac420494c608).\n        - Boom! Your claims have been submitted and once processed, you\u2019ll start receiving your state payments and top off payments from Uniswap.\n    - **Adding your child to your insurance**\n        \n        Submit a Qualifying Life Event in Sequoia using the guide below - This must be completed within\u00a0**30 days**\u00a0of the child\u2019s birth or placement.\n        \n        https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZFgmq_V71IZS7VgnGIutt_yhNNc7blLQ/view?usp=sharing\n        \n    - **Parental Leave FAQs**\n        - When should I let Uniswap Labs know I need parental leave?\n            - Whenever you feel comfortable sharing with us! We ask that you let us know no later than 30 days before your leave would start so we can plan, share logistics, and support you with coverage planning.\n        - Who do I need to notify of my need for parental leave?\n            - We encourage you to share with anyone you feel comfortable doing so, especially with your direct manager. However, ultimately, your PBP and People Ops are the only ones who need to know in order to process your leave.\n        - If I have concerns about telling people or about leaves who do I talk to?\n            - Reach out to your PBP to help navigate these conversations or to People Ops about the process surrounding leaves.\n        - I\u2019m a manager, is anything different for me?\n            - There is no difference in the way that Uniswap Labs processes leaves for managers vs ICs. As a manager, you will work more closely with your PBP to create a coverage plan while you are on your leave.\n        - Do I have to take my leave all at once?\n            - Nope! You can take your leave intermittently. However, we ask that you do so as a minimum of two week increments.\n        - Who decides how much time I take off?\n            - Ultimately, your health care provider determines how much time you need to take off. If you need more time than the Uniswap Labs paid parental leave allows for, you will be able to continue to take leave, but it will be unpaid.\n        - Do I need to file with my state?\n            - Yep! As a resident of your state that offers paid family leave, you have a deduction on your pay stub that contributes to this fund. Filing with the state allow you to benefit from the funds you contributed \ud83c\udd92 Uniswap Labs uses these funds to process your top off payment to get you to your 100% salary.\n        - What happens to my equity and token vesting while on parental leave?\n            - As long as you remain employed by Uniswap Labs your tokens and equity will continue to vest in accordance to your agreements. Your parental leave does not impact this \ud83d\ude0e\n        - What happens to my benefits while on parental leave?\n            - Your benefits remain active while on leave. When your child arrives, you will need to submit a qualifying life event (QLE) to add them to your insurance. At this point, you will also be able to change your health plans if you would like. Heads up that the only other time you can do this is during the annual open enrollment period.\n        - Is parental leave a protected type of leave?\n            - Yes, parental leaves are protected.\n        - Do I need to make a coverage plan for while I am on leave?\n            - Yep! Your PBP and manager will help with the creation of this to best support your team and allow you to focus on your new family member.\n        - What if someone reaches out to me while I am on leave?\n            - We ask that you change your slack status as OOO and add in an OOO reply to your email. This + a coverage plan, should help minimize this from occurring so you can focus on your new family member.\n        - What should I do when it is time to return from leave?\n            - As your return from leave date approaches, be in touch with @Sabrina Rossi. If anything changes on your end (i.e. coming back early or needing more time) we\u2019ll talk through your options.\n            - ***No changes?*** On your first day back to work let @Sabrina Rossi know so your status in Sequoia can be changed as returned from leave.\n        - What is considered a qualifying life event for insurance?\n            - A change in your situation \u2014 like getting married, having a baby, or losing health coverage \u2014  can make you eligible for a Special Enrollment Period, allowing you to enroll in health insurance outside the yearly Open Enrollment Period.\n        - Who do I talk to about SDI issues?\n            - You\u2019ll need to reach out to your state directly if you are experiencing any issues to your PFL or DI issues.\n                - [California](https://edd.ca.gov/en/about_edd/contact_edd)\n                - [New York](https://paidfamilyleave.ny.gov/) - \u00a0[(844) 337-6303](tel:(844) 337-6303)\n        - How do top off payments work?\n            - If you are eligible for a paid state leave fund, you\u2019ll follow the below process:\n                1. File your claim with the state.\n                2. When you receive your first payment or summary of benefits, share that with @Julian Sanchez  to show the amount of state funds you received.\n                    1. There may be a weeklong waiting period depending on your state. Your funds will come through after this has passed.\n                3. @Julian Sanchez  will forward this over to the Sequoia payroll team to then calculate the remaining amount owed to make you whole at 100% of your salary.\n                4. Repeat this process until you exhaust your state leave benefits. After which point, if applicable, you will be paid for at 100% by Uniswap Labs.\n        - When do I need to submit my paperwork by?\n            - For state leaves, the deadline to submit paperwork varies based on the state you live in.\n                - CA - 41 days after your child arrives.\n                - NY - 30 days after your child arrives.\n            - For qualifying life event paperwork, you have 30 days after the event occurs. In this case, 30 days after your child arrives.\n        - Do I fill out state paperwork or does the company?\n            - You will need to complete all of the employee sections of the state paperwork. We\u2019re only able to complete the employer sections **after** your employee sections are submitted.\n            \n- Unpaid Leave of Absences\n    \n    \n    **TL;DR** a personal unpaid leave of absence may be used for team members who need to step away from work in order to focus on a personal life event or activity.\n    \n    - What are the reasons I\u2019d take a personal unpaid leave of absence?\n        \n        These are some ideas we have, but this certainly does not include all the possibilities:\n        \n        1. A short-term development opportunity such as an apprenticeship, code school, educational institution, certification program, trade school, etc \ud83e\udde0\n        2. Volunteer or community service program that requires full-time focus \ud83d\udc9a\n        3. Personal or family care not otherwise protected under state or federal law (or where protected time does not extend long enough to cover the time needed) \ud83d\udc6a\n        \n        Whatever the reason, we offer a maximum of 6 weeks for an unpaid LOA.\n        \n    - How do I take a personal unpaid leave of absence?\n        1. Request the leave (in writing \ud83d\udcdd\u00a0pls!) to your Manager and PBP with the purpose, duration and start date\n        2. Your manager and PBP will review the request, eligibility, and business needs \ud83d\udcbc\n            - If not approved, your manager will let you know ASAP\n        3. Manager & PBP will give their +1 and elevate to the relevant Executive team member & VP of People for final \u27951\ufe0f\u20e3\n            - I+1s all around? Your manager will let you know and your PBP will send a confirmation email with next steps, template transition plan, and notes on benefits if applicable \ud83d\udc9e\n        4. ***Leave time up?*** You\u2019ll need to return on time \ud83d\udd50 and work with your manager to get back up to speed \u26a1\n    - How am I eligible for taking an Unpaid LOA like this?\n        1. Working with Uniswap full-time for a minimum of 6 months \ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f\n        2. Performance is up to expectations \ud83d\udc4d\n        3. The leave has been requested a quarter in advance \u23e9\n            \n            ***If the leave is unplanned/urgent, requesting with a shorter notice may still be approved.*\n            \n    - What else do I need to know?\n        \n        Ok ok the logistical stuff now\u2026\n        \n        - **Benefit payments:**\n            - You\u2019ll be responsible for your benefit premiums, 401(k) withdrawals, commuter benefit deductions, and mandatory payroll deductions while on leave.\n            - Heads up! These will be processed as a lump sum payment \ud83d\udcb0 deducted from your first paycheck upon returning from your leave.\n                - We understand this could cause a hardship, if this is the case let your PBP know and we\u2019ll work to find a resolution \ud83d\udc96\n        - **Work Coverage:**\n            - The work\u2019s still gotta get done! We\u2019ll need you to work with your manager to pass on outstanding work before you head out. We\u2019ve tried to make this easy for you and have created a [template here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1djC8_P0E2BU2PjRPaFVfmfogm4rDJNSFPw4rqqLcKWg/edit?usp=sharing) \ud83d\udcc3\n        - **Returning to work:**\n            - You\u2019ll need to work closely with your manager and People Ops the week prior to returning for planning \u21a9\ufe0f\n        - **Extensions:**\n            - We won\u2019t be able to extend your unpaid LOA without exceptional circumstances \ud83d\ude3f Should something exceptional arise, reach out to your manager and People Business Partner ASAP\n        - **Stacking:**\n            - Sorry friends, you\u2019re not able to stack an unpaid leave with another type of leave of absence \u2716\ufe0f\n        - **Role on return:**\n            - We can\u2019t promise that you will be able to return to the same role or team. We\u2019ll do everything we can, but the business needs to carry on while you are out \ud83e\udd0c\n    \n    **FAQs:**\n    \n    - Is this the same as PTO?\n        - Nope. Flexible time off is generally taken in increments of one day to two weeks for reasons such as vacations or general recharging of your batteries \ud83c\udf34\n    - Is this a sabbatical?\n        - Nope \ud83d\udc4e Uniswap does not have a sabbatical program. Although unpaid leaves and sabbaticals are both a form of time off, a sabbatical is taken after someone has significant tenure (3-4+ years) and you continue to be paid your regular salary. A personal leave of absence is unpaid and does not require significant tenure.\n    - Can I use this to take time off and travel for 6 weeks?\n        - If your travels would go over ~2 weeks at a time, pls work with your manager to understand your options for nomadic remote work. An unpaid leave is not intended to be used for general travel \ud83d\ude45\n\n---",

We will issue you a ramp card with a $2,000 limit and make all purchases using it. Once you max out that card, you\u2019ve maxed out your allowance.\n    \n    **What else do I need to know?**\n    \n    This is a one time offering and additional funds won\u2019t be available so spend \ud83d\udcb0\u00a0wisely! If you do need something in particular or if a piece of your tech broke, let us know and we can talk about an additional reimbursement even if you already used this allowance in full.\n    \n    ***Have Questions?*** The People team is here to help!\n    \n- Team Events\n    \n    \n    We \ud83d\udc93\u00a0team time here at Uniswap. So much so, we have a budget for each team to bond and connect outside of the normal day-to-day. Any event that promotes team bonding, learning, and/or productivity \u2014 and aligns with our values \u2014 is encouraged \u2b50.\n    \n    All the info you need to know on using this budget can be found below \ud83d\udc47. If you have any questions about the process or how the budget works, reach out to @Julian Sanchez or @Megan!\n    \n    ***What\u2019s the high level process?***\n    \n    1. Team leads, or someone they delegate, should reach out to @Julian Sanchez or @Megan to kick things off. People Ops will then let you know what budget you have available to you and can provide recommendations. \n        - The budget is the same regardless of the team you work on = ***$75/person each quarter.***\n    2. Teams will be responsible for planning and sharing the logistics with everyone attending. If the event allows for prepayment, People Ops can process the payment with our Ramp card.\n        - If the event requires payment at the time of the event, such as a dinner, the team lead should either use one of their Ramp cards or expense it.\n    3. After the event, the team lead will share the final costs and number of attendees with People Ops for tracking.\n    4. Have a blast with the team!\n    \n    **Frequently Asked Questions**\n    \n    - What kinds of events can we plan?\n        \n        Events can be anything you can think of! Similar to our NYC office events, these can be dinners, activities, shows, whatever your idea is we\u2019ll try to make it happen with you. Just don\u2019t forget to run your idea by @Julian Sanchez or @Megan before booking.\n        \n    - Why can we only do one event per quarter?\n        \n        We have a limited budget for these so we ask that each team only plans one gathering per quarter so each team can use their budget.\n        \n    - Do these events have to be in person or can we do something with remote peeps too?\n        \n        These events can absolutely be hybrid and include remote team members! Unfortunately, the budget is not big enough to allow for travel for them to attend the events.\n        \n        However, if they are utilizing their [NYC Visits](https://www.notion.so/NYC-Visits-ac380e0cf04f4101bfdb207cf6bbd801?pvs=21) budget and are in town, now that\u2019s a great time to plan a team event.\n        \n    - Why is the budget per person?\n        \n        We calculate all of event budgets at the per person cost to make sure that we have everyone fully covered and teams both big and small, can do events they want to do.\n        \n    - Do our events need to include everyone on the team?\n        \n        Team events are meant to be inclusive and an opportunity for the whole team to bond together. This means that yes, everyone needs to be invited.\n        \n    - If someone can\u2019t attend, does that mean we can still use their budget?\n        \n        Unfortunately, the budget is based off of those who are attending the events. This means that if only 5 of the 7 people on your team can attend, you only have the budget for 5 people. \n        \n        However, if someone can\u2019t make it last minute, that will be covered under your budget.\n        \n    - Can our budget roll over from quarter to quarter?\n        \n        You can rollover one quarters worth of budget to the next but all budget resets each year. Our hope with this is that you do actually use your funds!\n        \n    - Does our budget increase if we hire someone new during the year?\n        \n        We set the budgets at the beginning of each year in accordance with our expected headcount/hiring plan for the year so these budgets already include these new hires!\n        \n    - Why does the budget for events sit with the People Ops team?\n        \n        The budget sits with People Ops for tracking purposes. The team takes note of the costs incurred, attendees, and can even support you with planning your events!\n        \n    - Will execs get a report out on what we use our budget for?\n        \n        Yep! Execs will receive a quarterly update on which teams used their budget, for what, and how much of it so they can encourage you to keep spending quality time with your team!\n        \n- Team Onsites\n    \n    \n    ***What\u2019s this page?*** Your guide for planning and attending team or pod onsites. **TLDR** = fill out our request form, share with @Megan Roberts and stick to the guidelines on this page. Have questions? Ask a member of the People team \ud83d\ude03\n    \n    <aside>\n    \ud83d\udca1\n    \n    **2025 update:** Based on your feedback, we\u2019re piloting a pre-planned timing of July 14-18 to help get cross-functional teams here at the tame time. \n    \n    - why: midway betweeen all-UL onsites to avoid too-close-together travel\n    - what if we don\u2019t like this week: plan with your cross-functional peers & DM @Megan\n    </aside>\n    \n    ### **What are team onsites?**\n    \n    Onsites are a great way to talk big picture, kick off or work on projects, bond, and learn from each other. We \u2764\ufe0f\u00a0team time and believe coming together annually will help you accomplish incredible work. Bonus - you\u2019ll get to spend more time in our fabulous office.\n    \n    ### **How do we plan onsites?**\n    \n    1. Complete the [request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1VsG-m-OOY9Ce5I6kGJnMGuwpB-IZXJzp11_RrmZCfxM/edit) with your goals and wait for confirmation from the People Team - you\u2019ll hear from either @Megan or @Julian Sanchez  \ud83d\udc4b\n    2. We\u2019ll set up some time to chat with you about your goals, outline how it works and budget stuff, and answer any questions you may have \n    3. Follow our guidelines and have a blast together \ud83c\udf8a\n    \n    ## Onsite Guidelines:\n    \n    - (see above pilot callout) Onsites should be planned 6 weeks before they are set to take place. Ty for planning \ud83d\ude4f\n    - Uniswap covers one onsite for teams annually. Onsites are based off your teams, not pods.\n    - Onsites & associated travel should in totality be no more than one week\n    - Onsites need to have a purpose. Your chill and vibe time together will happen naturally \ud83d\udc97\n    - All onsites will take place in our NYC HQ \ud83c\udf4e\n        - ***Why?*** We have a sweet office and with our limited budget for onsites, this is our best bet\n    - Our [Experiences & Expenses guidelines](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z17u-ayvDWvL1uzJZcF93uveWL9fyw_s/view) still apply for onsites. Check those out if you\u2019re unfamiliar with them \ud83d\ude0e\n    \n    ### FAQs\n    \n    - Can we stay in an airbnb?\n        \n        Nope. We ask that you stay in hotels for everyone\u2019s comfort and safety. Hotels will allow everyone to have their own rooms and space and offer an extra layer of safety that airbnbs don\u2019t. \n        \n        We recommend that everyone traveling for your offsite stays at the same hotel - we\u2019re happy to help set up room blocks if you\u2019re a large team!\n        \n    - What is the budget that we have for onsites?\n        - Flights & Hotels for non-NYC locals booked through [Navan](http://navan.com) and within policy\n        - One team dinner up to $60/person for the length of the offsite\n        - Want to do something not noted here? Chat with @Julian Sanchez\n    - Ok got it that our onsite has to be in NYC, can we airbnb there?\n        \n        Sorry, friend. Nope. The answer to the above question applies here too.\n        \n    - Do we have to focus on work during the onsite?\n        \n        Your offsite time can be used for a variety of work reasons. We ask that you have a genuine goal to accomplish with your gathering. Chill and vibe time will happen naturally, but isn\u2019t the goal here\n        \n    - How do team dinners work with the meal stipend?\n        \n        All team dinners need to be in line with our expense guidelines. You can check those guidelines out [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z17u-ayvDWvL1uzJZcF93uveWL9fyw_s/view). \n        \n    - What if we stay in the budget, then can we do our own thing?\n        \n        As long as you\u2019re within budget and these guidelines, NYC is your playground. The workplace experience team can help with some recommended activities and restaurants. \n        \n    - If we live in NYC can we get hotel rooms too?\n        \n        If you live in NYC already, you live in the greatest city! So, no, you will not be able to get hotel rooms. \n        \n    - The office isn't \"off\" site, can we rent a space?\n        \n        Sadly \ud83d\ude1e\u00a0no. We have a limited budget for this program and space rentals are expensive. We have invested lots of time and $$$ for our fabulous office and want you to take advantage of it!\n        \n    - Is there an annual budget for onsites?\n        \n        Yep! We have an annual budget and if it\u2019s exceeded for the year early on, we sadly will decline further requests. Budgets are based on per head attending so we\u2019ll work with you on how much you\u2019ll have available to you. Please be mindful of spending so that all unicorns \ud83e\udd84 can partake in this offering!\n        \n    - What if our team is all on the west coast?\n        \n        Let\u2019s talk about this one! It may make more sense, and be more cost effective, to make an exception to our NYC only guideline. \n        \n- NYC Visits\n    \n    \n    So you wanna come work with the NYC team? We don\u2019t blame you, our office is sweet and in person team collaboration is invaluable. Before you do, check out the below info for the helpful deets you need to know including how often and how long you can. \n    \n    If you\u2019re planning a visit that isn\u2019t addressed by these FAQs, we\u2019re hear to chat and make magic happen when possible.\n    \n    ***How do I visit?***\n    \n    1. Chat with your manager on if it would be beneficial for you and the team and align on dates that work. You can visit NYC a max of 4 times a year, including our bi-annual onsites.\n    2. Give @Julian Sanchez  a heads up that you\u2019re planning a trip and they\u2019ll make sure your team has enough budget for your trip and let you know what desk will be reserved for you.\n    3. Once you get +1 from People Ops, book your travel in Navan in accordance with the Experiences & Expense policy. A heads up given our limited budget, we can only cover a max of 5 nights in a hotel.\n    4. When you\u2019re traveling, use your Navan card for all expenses incurred on work travel.\n    \n    **Frequently Asked Questions**\n    \n    - Why can I only come once a quarter including onsites?\n        \n        We have set budgets for teams based on the number of expected travelers. Keeping visits to once a quarter including onsites allows us to make sure everyone can travel when needed.\n        \n    - How long can I stay when I visit?\n        \n        Uniswap will cover the costs for a maximum of five hotel nights within budget. If you are traveling during a week where hotel costs are over budget, you may be asked to stay for a shorter period of time or come another week.\n        \n    - Can I stay longer if I stay with friends or family?\n        \n        Sure can! In this case you are welcome to stay as long as you would like but your meals will only be covered for up to five days.\n        \n    - What if there is a business need for me to visit more frequently?\n        \n        If there is a business need approved by your team lead and executive, then you can visit more frequently but your travel costs will still be tracked within the overall budget.\n        \n    - Who tracks the budget spend for these visits?\n        \n        The People Operations team tracks the budget spend for these visits as the owner of the Navan system. This includes the cost tracking for your hotel, flights, and charges put on your Navan credit card while traveling.\n        \n    - Do I need to have a reason to visit?\n        \n        We ask that you have a reason to visit NYC if you are choosing a particular week to come. If you do not have a business need, and the timing selected is a peak time with higher travel costs, we may ask you to select a different week to travel in.\n        \n    - Does a team or company onsite count towards my visit?\n        \n        Yes, these would count towards your visits. You can discuss with your manager and People Ops if it makes sense for you to come early or stay late after these. \n        \n    - If I\u2019m an international employee, are my visits restricted to the same time length?\n        \n        You can discuss this with your manager and the People Ops team. The ultimate answer to this depends on available budget and costs during the timeframe you are planning on coming.\n        \n- Relocations\n    \n    \n    So you wanna pack up and move to NYC? We don\u2019t blame you, it\u2019s awesome here. Before you do, check out the below info. If your role falls into the guidelines below, we\u2019ll provide you with an $8,000 pre-tax stipend for you to come work with us at HQ - no reimbursement requests needed. Questions about this process or if your role qualifies? Reach out to @Julian Sanchez .\n    \n    **Okay, but how?**\n    \n    - **New Hires**\n        - When you were hired, was it clear that you needed to relocate for your new role? If yes, that should be outlined in your offer letter. Feel free to check it if you\u2019re not sure.\n        - Nothing noted in your offer letter but you still want to move? Check out the section below \u2014 note that moves are only covered if there is a true business need.\n    - **Current Team Members**\n        1. Talk with your manager and your executive team member about whether it would benefit Uniswap to have your role based out of our NYC HQ. Typically, these are leadership roles or roles on the Product, Eng, and Design teams.\n        2. If your manager and executive are aligned, reach out to @Julian Sanchez to receive approval from the Finance and People Ops team. \n        3. If approved, let Finance & People Ops know your expected move timeline. Something change? All good! We\u2019ll check in 2 weeks before what you shared initially.\n        4. After you officially move, welcome to New York! People Ops will send you an official change of location note and outline how to update your new address in Sequoia. Make sure to do that ASAP so your taxes aren't impacted!\n        5. Within 30 days of your move, we\u2019ll add the $8,000 stipend to your paycheck.\n            1. This will be treated as a bonus from a tax perspective and will be required to be paid back to the company if you leave within one year of the issuance date.\n    \n    **Frequently Asked Questions**\n    \n    - Is the stipend subject to taxes?\n        - Yes, the stipend is subject to all taxes. The stipend is viewed as a bonus and taxed in accordance to IRS regulations.\n    - Can I get the stipend before my move?\n        - No. The stipends are only able to be issued after your move has been completed.\n    - What happens if I leave the company before I reach my one year mark?\n        - Under the terms of your relocation stipend issuance, you will be required to repay the company the funds issued to you. We\u2019ll let you know how to do this if this comes up.\n    - What if I recently moved to NYC and did not receive a stipend?\n        - Relocation stipends are not issued retroactively. We know NYC is sweet, but we will only issue stipends for those who have a business need, not just because you want to live here.\n    - When can I expect the stipend payment to be issued?\n        - We\u2019ll do our best to get this out to you as soon as we can after your move has taken place. It will arrive within 1-2 paychecks after you move.\n    - If I am an intern/fellow being converted to full time, am I eligible?\n        \n        Yes! This will be noted in your offer letter to join us full time.\n        \n\n---",

Our goals are ambitious, and our leaders are empowered to build lean teams where each person has an opportunity to make a significant impact. Our team members are multifaceted, with plenty of interests outside work, as writers, parents, musicians, athletes, artists and more. We believe this is an important part of building a culture of creativity, which manifests through the novel products we deliver to the world. \n\n# At-Will Employment {#at-will-employment}\n\nEmployment with Uniswap Labs is \u201cat-will\u201d. This means that employment may be terminated at any time by the employee or Uniswap Labs with or without cause, and with or without advance notice. The at-will relationship includes the right to hire, transfer, promote, reclassify, layoff, discipline, terminate or change any term or condition of employment (except for at-will employment itself) at any time with or without cause or advance notice. Our policy of \u201cat will\u201d employment cannot be changed except by a formal written agreement specifically entered into for this purpose signed by a member of the executive team.  \n\nNeither this employee handbook, nor any policy or practice of Uniswap Labs, is intended to imply continued or guaranteed employment, or otherwise limit in any way the policy of at-will employment. In describing Uniswap Labs\u2019 policies and procedures, this handbook does not obligate Uniswap Labs to follow any particular procedure in the course of imposing discipline or terminating employment.\n\nOur goal is to have the best team possible, and this means having the best people possible. Your experience with Uniswap Labs should be mutually beneficial; of course we want to grow our Uniswap Labs, and we also want to foster the growth and development of all our team members. If we\u2019re not holding up our end of the bargain, make sure to let us know.\n\n# \n\n# Vision, Mission and Values\n\nOur Vision  \nWe envision a world where everyone exchanges value through fair, accessible markets on the internet. In this new economy, value is global, within reach, and flows to creators and contributors. Uniswap Labs builds foundational products and infrastructure to bring this vision to life. \n\nOur Mission  \nUnlock universal ownership and exchange.",

They are our daily guideposts for how we interact with each other, our users, and our community.*\n\n**People First**\n\nWe believe easy, safe, fair value transfer on the internet can improve people\u2019s lives. Access, security and experience is the center of everything we do. By pursuing decentralization, interoperability, and durability we align with our users over the long-term, and win. Internally, people are our greatest asset, and we strive for an environment where everyone can make an incredible impact. We share direct, kind feedback so we can improve. When we advocate for an idea, a technical tradeoff, or a business goal, we start with why \u2014 why it\u2019s better for our user, our company.\n\n**Simple**\n\nOur craft is keeping it simple. In a complex field, we create clarity & simplicity. We write and build in human terms, understood by everyone. This shows up in the design and language of our user experience, across our code, and in how we speak to the world and each other. We are deliberate in the words and images we use.\n\n**Pink**\n\nWe love pink, conceptually and irl. Disrupting the status quo is fun. We hold each other accountable to do serious work \u2013 without taking ourselves too seriously. We love unicorns, and we bring whimsy into our experiments and our day-to-day.  The people-first, internet-native financial system we\u2019re building welcomes anyone.\n\n**Push Through Ambiguity Together**\n\nStartup life can be ambiguous \u2014 and especially at the frontier. We are at peace with the uncertainty. We push through resistance. We show up ready to explore new ideas. We have conviction that our mission is worth it. When things get hard, we stay on the same team. We create scalable solutions to make things less ambiguous in pursuit of our mission. We don\u2019t assume shared knowledge or beliefs across our team or our users, and we seek to understand others\u2019 \u201cwhy.\u201d When we don\u2019t agree with something, we assume positive intent & default to trust.\n\n**Build to last, iterate fast**\n\nWe see through the clouds of today into what\u2019s possible tomorrow. We don\u2019t fall prey to short-term thinking or get distracted by narratives and prices. We aim to move fast, learn from our mistakes, and we ship when it\u2019s right. Where our opinions bring safety, simplicity, and new choices in the best interest of our users, we express them. This long-term view is a big part of why we are a beloved brand. We must protect it.\n\n| How We Keep You Safe |\n| :---: |\n\n![][image2]",

Whenever you\u2019re faced with a decision, always do what you know is ethically right, and, of course, always follow the law.\n\nWe expect that team members will not knowingly misrepresent Uniswap Labs and will not speak on behalf of Uniswap Labs unless specifically authorized. The confidentiality of proprietary information, and confidential or commercially-sensitive information (i.e. business strategies, business initiatives, business relationships or business, legal or financial affairs etc.) which we haven\u2019t released to the public or is not generally known about Uniswap Labs, or that of our customers or partners (i.e., \u201ctrade secret\u201d), is to be treated with discretion and only disseminated on a need-to-know basis.\n\nWe strive to improve the quality of our services, products, and operations and will maintain a reputation for honesty, fairness, respect, responsibility, integrity, trust, and sound business judgment.\n\nViolation of the Code of Ethics can result in discipline, up to and including termination of employment.

You should receive your laptop before or on your first day. You will be able to access all work related platforms such as email, internal apps/webs, Intranet, Slack, Zoom and other relevant platforms. All of our devices are equipped with Mobile Device Management (MDM).\n\nTreatment of Laptops  \nNotify the IT team if your laptop becomes damaged or isn\u2019t working properly. They will work with you to get it fixed or replaced.\n\nAs your laptop is Uniswap property, at the time of offboarding, you will need to return your laptop. Instructions will be provided to you on how to do so at the time of offboarding.\n\nTreatment of Laptops: Returning your laptop\n\nElectronic Communications  \nAll information created, sent, received, or stored on Uniswap Labs\u2019 electronic resources is Uniswap Labs property (this includes computer, email, instant messaging, company issued cell phones and voicemails, fax, Intranets, and the Web  \\- even when accessed from personal devices) and should be used for job-related purposes during working time and at all other times. Such information is not the private property of any employee and team members should have no expectation of privacy in the use or contents of Uniswap Labs' electronic resources. Passwords do not confer any right of privacy upon any employee of Uniswap Labs. Team members should understand that Uniswap Labs may monitor the usage of its electronic resources and may access, review, and disclose information stored on its electronic resources, including messages, personal email communications sent and received on the employer's computers but using private email accounts, and other data, at any time, with or without advance notice to the user or the user's consent. In order to ensure that the usage of such electronics remains ethical and lawful, team members must abide by the following guidelines:\n\n* Uniswap Labs-issued laptops are only for work purposes to protect the security of Company information and your own privacy, in the event that Uniswap Labs needs to pull or monitor information on your work laptop.\n\n* To avoid phishing or malware emails, do not open e-mail messages from unknown senders or advertisers; rather, delete the emails or contact the People and Operations teams.\n\n* To prevent computer viruses from being transmitted through the system, team members are not authorized to download any software from the internet onto their computer or any drive in that computer unless authorized.\n\n* Use of portable drives to download Uniswap Labs information for any purpose other than Uniswap Labs business is prohibited without the advance written approval by the Uniswap Labs\u2019 management. \n\n* To protect against interception of Uniswap Labs\u2019s Confidential Information, please make sure that appropriate safeguards are used (e.g., encryption) for sensitive information.\n\n* Do not use Uniswap Labs\u2019 systems in a manner that could infringe on or violate the copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret or other proprietary rights of third parties. You should not knowingly use or distribute any such material downloaded from the internet or received by email without the prior written permission of the Legal team. If you have any questions, speak to your Manager or a member of the legal team.\n\n* Uniswap Labs assumes no liability for loss, damage, disclosure, or misuse of any non-Uniswap Labs data or communications transmitted or stored on the Uniswap Labs's electronic resources. \n\n*  Team members may not, without authorization, transmit, retrieve, or store confidential Uniswap Labs information on their personal email systems. Unless otherwise allowed by law, confidential Uniswap Labs information, whether in electronic or hardcopy form, may only be accessed and used by team members as required to perform job duties.\n\n* You may not bypass, turn off or disable any antivirus protection software that Uniswap Labs provides or make unauthorized changes to system configurations installed on Uniswap Labs Systems.\n\n* You may not sign on to any Uniswap Labs System using the password or user name of another employee. Sharing such account passwords is strictly prohibited.\n\nSlack Policy  \nAt Uniswap Labs we use Slack as an internal messaging and collaboration tool. You will receive training on how to use it during your first week.\n\n Guidelines:\n\n*  If you create a channel, you are responsible for defining the purpose and expectations of what should be shared in the channel. Post this information in the channel.  \n* To support an inclusive work environment, please include your preferred pronouns on your profile. (e.g. \u201cJohn Doe \\-(they/them))  \n* Be mindful of the channels\u2019 member list before you start messaging. Keep conversations in both public and private channels work-appropriate.  \n* Take Slack conversations to email, phone, or face-to-face when required.  \n* Reserve @here, @channel, or @\\[name\\] for important or urgent matters only.  \n*  Update statuses accordingly and regularly, especially when away or OOO.  \n* Acknowledge receipt of messages and requests, even if you can\u2019t focus on the message or request until later.  \n*  Avoid sending multiple messages when you don\u2019t get an immediate response. Colleagues may be in meetings or doing \u201cdeep work\u201d.  \n* Be smart with your messages and share context and complete thoughts. For example, don\u2019t send a direct message that just says \u201chi\u201d to avoid unnecessary notifications and use threads to organize discussions.  \n* When an employee receives outreach from a third-party regarding Governance, the employee should assume the outreach is in their capacity as an employee and share information about the outreach internally on the \\#governance slack and note how the employee plans to respond to the outreach or to coordinate a response with others internally regarding the outreach, or on the \\#privileged-legal-sensitive, if there is a question about how these policies apply to a response.\n\nGoogle Meet (video) Policy  \nAt Uniswap Labs we use Google Meet to have video calls. \n\n Guidelines:\n\n* Google Meet is the preferred communication medium for meetings \u2013 even if meeting in person, please make sure there\u2019s a Google Meet link in the invite as some people may be unexpectedly remote.  \n* Ensure your camera and microphone are working before the start of each meeting. Turn your camera on unless it\u2019s not possible. This helps build engagement among colleagues and facilitates communication.  \n* In your display name, you may include your preferred pronouns.  \n* Mute your microphone when you are not an active participant to minimize background noise.  \n* Be mindful of the background visible in your Meets meeting. Limit distractions. While some distractions are unavoidable, try to limit distractions by turning off Slack notifications, putting your phone down etc.  \n* Avoid multitasking. You were invited to the meeting for a reason.",

        "content": "## Social Media Guidelines  {#social-media-guidelines}\n\nIt is important to us that we maintain healthy relationships not just internally, but also externally with the Uniswap Labs community. One of our favorite ways to engage is through our social media platforms, and we have some guidance for how best to do that outlined below. \n\nUniswap Labs\u2019 Official Accounts  \nWe have official Uniswap Labs accounts on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/FCfyBSbCU5), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Uniswap), and [Github](https://github.com/Uniswap), all of which are easily found through our [website](https://uniswap.org/). Familiarize yourself with the Uniswap Labs brand and audiences; it is a great way to build relationships with consumers. We encourage you to follow  us on any and all of these platforms to stay up to date & informed. \n\nPersonal Social Media Accounts  \nShould you choose to engage in social media via your personal accounts, please use your best judgment when deciding what to post. Remember that an employee of Uniswap Labs, can be interpreted as representing the company. If you have something you want to post about the markets, your experience at work in the general sense, your thoughts on crypto, might be interpreted as coming by the Uniswap Labs team, please run it by the communications team before posting.\n\nGuidelines:\n\n* We expect that all Uniswap Labs team members will protect proprietary, confidential and copyrighted information, as well as refrain from posting derogatory content.  \n* Avoid using your social accounts to pump your bags \u2013 shilling tokens or projects for your own gain doesn\u2019t represent you or Uniswap Labs in an ethical or reputable way. If you are using applications that distribute tokens and are tied to Twitter or other social accounts, we encourage you to not include any affiliation to Uniswap.   \n* Be a crypto and web3 community evangelist \\- avoid spreading FUD or being a price puppeteer.   \n* Feel free to show your creativity or rep a favorite artist by using NFTs for your profile image.  \n* Consider the images and personal life details you share \\- drug usage, drug paraphernalia, discriminatory or hate speech, disrespectful statements and/or other similar content will be on the internet and follow you forever, and will be interpreted by some as a representation of the UL brand in a negative light. Some posts could also violate this policy so be smart about what you share.\n\nPotential clients and partners will want to get to know the organization and sometimes even team members; always present your best and true self. We will not continuously monitor your personal accounts, however all content you post should be done responsibly. We reserve the right to discipline team members in accordance with our policies for any content posted that is deemed inappropriate. \n\nWhen talking about the Protocol, you **must** follow these guidelines (on Social Media and/or informal settings):\n\n* Feel free to discuss the protocol generally: what it is, how it works, how it originated, what makes it unique, how it is better than any other protocol or AMM or the legacy financial system, etc.\n\n* Feel free to discuss the vibrant community, many integrations, and varied ecosystem contributions related to the Uniswap protocol. \n\nWays you **should not** talk about the Uniswap protocol, Uniswap Labs, or the UNI token (on Social Media and/or informal settings):\n\n* Do not use \u201cUniswap\u201d as a stand alone term or shorthand wherever possible. Always refer to \u201cUniswap Labs\u201d, the \u201cUniswap team\u201d, the \u201cUniswap protocol\u201d, \u201cUniswap interface\u201d, etc.  \n\n* Do not use \u201cwe\u201d to refer to the protocol (e.g., don\u2019t say \u201cwe do 1B in daily volume\u201d). If you are talking about the team or the interface, use \u201cUniswap Labs\u201d or \u201cUniswap interface\u201d. If you mean the protocol, say \u201cUniswap protocol\u201d. \n\n* Do not highlight the ability to do a token sale through the Uniswap protocol.\n\n* Do not mention the price of anything ever, expressly or implicitly. \n\n  * **Do not mention the UNI token price ever**\\--not even implicit references to increases (e.g., don\u2019t tweet \u201cWhat an amazing day\\!\u201d after UNI has a big jump). \n\n  * If you\u2019re ever asked about UNI, you can say Uniswap Labs does not speculate on the future price of UNI.\n\n  * Do not talk about the price of other tokens. The exception here is you can talk about the price of Bitcoin, ETH, or the very general token market (\u201cbull\u201d or \u201cbear\u201d etc.), as long as you\u2019re not using one of them as a proxy for UNI (e.g., don\u2019t say \u201cUNI is the biggest app on Ethereum and ETH is up today\u2026\u201d).\n\n  * You can talk about the price of Unisocks. Just don\u2019t suggest it might go up from the current price.\n\n* Do not encourage people to buy and sell cryptocurrency (e.g., \u201chodl\\!\u201d \u201cbuy the dip\\!\u201d).\n\n  * Avoid anything that could look like investment advice.\n\n* Generally do not publicly engage in conversations regarding the protocol fee switch that may accrue to UNI tokens.\n\n  * Do not say anything that might imply the price of UNI may go up, that we want it to go up, or are happy when it goes up. \n\n* Do not suggest that anyone should expect an airdrop. \n\n* Do not encourage anyone\u2019s expectations that people should rely on Uniswap Labs\u2019s efforts to make the protocol succeed and especially not to make the UNI token valuable. Highlight community efforts so people don\u2019t incorrectly get the impression that they should rely on us exclusively to drive any value to the UNI token.\n\n* Generally try not to reference competitors such as Pancakeswap or Sushiswap because it\u2019s free publicity for them.",

Full-time team members are eligible for all benefits, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefit program.                                                                 \n\nPart-time team members are those regularly scheduled to work fewer than 30 hours per week and at least 20 hours per week. Part-time team members are not eligible for employee benefits, but may receive Uniswap Labs perks on an as-needed basis.\n\n**Fixed term** team members work for Uniswap Labs for a defined period of time to work on specific projects or tasks. These team members are eligible for our healthcare benefits if they are working full time hours.\n\nTemporary or Special-team members are hired for a specific period of employment (such as for a temporary replacement for an employee on a leave of absence or an internship), or for a special project. These temporary team members do not receive any of Uniswap Labs\u2019 benefits, other than those required to be provided by applicable law.\n\nNon-Employee Categories: Independent contractors, consultants, and agency service providers are not Uniswap Labs team members and are not eligible for any Uniswap Labs-sponsored employment benefits. You are an agency service provider if you perform services for Uniswap Labs through an independent contract service or agency, whether as a leased employee, contractor, temporary or similar designation.\n\nExempt: This term refers to those team members whose duties and responsibilities make them exempt from overtime compensation requirements, as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). If an Employee is classified as exempt, they do not receive compensation for overtime worked. If you have a question regarding whether you are exempt or nonexempt, contact your Manager for clarification.\n\nNon-Exempt \\- Overtime: By law, non-exempt team members may be compensated by equivalent time off for extra hours worked, provided the hours are scheduled and taken within the same pay period in which the work occurs. Overtime may not be worked without a Manager\u2019s approval. Non-Exempt team members are required to report all hours worked in a timekeeping system established by Uniswap Labs\u2019 timekeeping system. When overtime is paid, the Employee\u2019s wage rate increases to 1.5 times the normal hourly rate after 40 hours have been worked in a work week (defined as Sunday through Saturday). Additional overtime requirements may apply in certain states outside of New York (see below for California).\n\nTeam members who fail to obtain approval prior to working overtime should still record all overtime worked. Team members will be paid for all work performed.

        "content": "## Zero Tolerance Harassment and Discrimination Policy  {#zero-tolerance-harassment-and-discrimination-policy}\n\nUniswap Labs is proud to be an equal opportunity employer (EEO). We provide employment opportunities without regard to age, race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, disability (including gender dysphoria and similar gender-related conditions), sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation (including actual or perceived heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, and asexuality), veteran status, military status, domestic violence victim status, reproductive health decision making or any other protected category\\*.  Both Uniswap Labs and the law prohibit unlawful employment discrimination. Unlawful discrimination occurs when an employer makes employment decisions, including hiring, promotion, raises, termination, and other terms and conditions of employment, based on the protected class of an applicant or employee, and not on merit. \n\nIn New York State and/or New York City, Protected Categories include traits historically associated with race (including but not limited to hair texture and protective hairstyles), creed, ancestry, alienage, familial or marital status, partnership status, caregiver status, gender, gender expression, the employee\u2019s or the employee\u2019s dependent\u2019s reproductive health decision making (including but not limited to a decision to use or access a particular drug, device or medical service), status as a victim of domestic violence, sex offenses or stalking, engaging in certain lawful off-duty and off-site legally protected recreational activities, and, in certain circumstances, unemployment status, credit history, salary history and arrest and conviction history.  All such discrimination is unlawful and against Uniswap Labs policy.  This policy applies to all aspects of employment, including, but not limited to, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, and termination, and it covers all individuals providing services in the workplace, including team members, interns, consultants, independent contractors, subcontractors, vendors and others providing services pursuant to a contract in the workplace (or team members of such persons).\n\n\\**classification protected by applicable state, federal, or local laws*     \nZero Tolerance Harassment Policy  \nBoth Uniswap Labs and the law also prohibit unlawful workplace harassment. Unlawful harassment is any conduct that creates an intimidating, offensive, or abusive working environment or subjects an individual to inferior terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. Harassment on the basis of any other protected class is also strictly prohibited. Prohibited harassment can take many forms, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n* Making or using derogatory comments, emails, letters, epithets, slurs, or explicit jokes.  \n* Derogatory posters, photographs, cartoons, drawings, websites, emails, text messages, or gestures.  \n* Touching, assaulting, impeding, or blocking normal movements.\n\nThis policy applies to all individuals providing services in the workplace and prohibits unlawful discrimination or harassment of or by team members, interns, consultants, independent contractors, subcontractors, vendors and others providing services pursuant to a contract in the workplace (or team members of such persons). In addition to this Policy, team members will be required to complete Harassment Prevention training on an annual basis.\n\nSexual harassment is a specific type of harassment involving either unwelcome sexual advances, or visual, verbal, or physical conduct based on sex, gender, pregnancy, or related stereotypes. Sexually harassing conduct can be between persons of the same or different genders.   \nSexual harassment also includes harassment that is not sexual in nature (for example, offensive remarks about an individual's sex or gender), as well as any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any other conduct of a sexual nature, when any of the following is true:\n\n* Submission to or rejection of the advance, request, or conduct is:  made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment; or used as a basis for employment decisions.  \n* The advances, requests, or conduct have the purpose or effect of substantially or unreasonably interfering with an employee's work performance by creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment, even if the complaining individual is not the intended target of the harassment.\n\nExamples of prohibited conduct include:\n\n* Verbal Sexual Harassment: Sexual innuendo, comments reflecting sex- or gender-based stereotypes, sexually suggestive comments, jokes of a sexual nature, sexual advances or propositions, offers of employment benefits in exchange for sexual favors, threatened or actual reprisals after a negative response to sexual advances, or graphic commentaries about a person\u2019s body.  \n* Written Sexual Harassment: Leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive objects or pictures, cartoons or posters, suggestive or insulting sounds, suggestive or obscene notes or letters or any social media platforms (both personal and work related).  \n* Physical Sexual Harassment: Physical contact of a sexual nature, including sexually suggestive or offensive touching, impeding, or blocking movements, fondling, kissing, massaging, or brushing up against the body.  \n* Online (for example, derogatory jokes or statements or sexually suggestive postings in any social media platform including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, etc.).\n\nThis list is illustrative only, and not exhaustive. Uniswap Labs prohibits all forms of sexual and discriminatory harassment at the workplace and at employer-sponsored events.\n\nWhere and When Harassment Can Occur  \nHarassment can occur not only at the workplace but at client meetings, business conferences, while traveling for business or at employer-sponsored parties and events.  Calls, texts, emails and social media usage by team members can constitute unlawful workplace harassment, even if they occur away from the workplace premises, on personal devices or during non-work hours.  \n\nComplaint Procedure  \nIf you have been subjected to or witness any behavior that may constitute sexual or other harassment, discrimination or any other violation of this policy, you are encouraged to promptly speak to, write, email, or otherwise contact your Manager, a member of the People Operations team, or any other member of senior management with whom you feel comfortable.    \n\t  \nComplaints or reports may be made verbally or in writing.  To submit a written complaint, individuals are encouraged to use the [Complaint Form](#harassment-complaint-form), which is available at the end of this Handbook.  Individuals who are reporting a complaint on behalf of other individuals should use the Complaint Form and note that it is on another person\u2019s behalf.  The complaint should be as detailed as possible, including the names of all individuals involved and any witnesses. \n\nThe effectiveness of Uniswap Labs\u2019 efforts depends largely on individuals telling us about inappropriate workplace conduct.  If individuals feel that they or someone else may have been subjected to conduct that violates this policy, it should be reported immediately.  If individuals do not report sexually harassing or other harassing conduct, Uniswap Labs may not become aware of a possible violation of this policy and may not be able to take appropriate corrective action.  \n\nInvestigation by Uniswap Labs  \nUniswap Labs takes all complaints of sexual and other discriminatory harassment seriously and will promptly and thoroughly investigate the facts and circumstances of all complaints, whether the complaint was made verbally or in writing.  Any employee may be required to cooperate as needed in an investigation of suspected sexual or other harassment. \n\nWhile the investigation process may vary from case to case, Uniswap Labs\u2019 investigation may involve one or more of the following:  interviewing the complaining party and the individual about whom the complaint was made;  taking any interim actions as appropriate;  obtaining, reviewing and preserving relevant documents, including electronic communications; interviewing any relevant witnesses;  and documenting the investigation. Uniswap Labs will promptly notify the complaining party and the individual about whom the complaint was made of the completion of the investigation and, as appropriate, of the final determination. Uniswap Labs will take prompt corrective action as appropriate to eliminate sexual and other harassment, including disciplinary measures up to and including termination of employment.\n\nAll persons involved, including complainants, witnesses, and alleged harassers, will be accorded due process to protect their rights to a fair and impartial investigation.  The investigation will be kept confidential to the greatest extent possible, consistent with conducting a thorough and fair investigation.  \n\nAlternative Reporting and Remedies   \nUniswap Labs encourages individuals to report incidents of harassment and any other violation of this policy internally. However, individuals who believe they have been subjected to sexual or other harassment or discrimination in the workplace also may seek relief by:   \n \n\n* Filing a \"Charge of Discrimination\" with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for violation of federal anti-discrimination laws, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII).  You can contact the EEOC by calling 1-800-669-4000 (TTY: 1-800-669-6820), visiting their website at [http://www.eeoc.gov](http://www.eeoc.gov), or by email at info@eeoc.gov.  \n    \n* Team members working in New York State may file a complaint alleging violation of the New York State Human Rights Law, either with the New York State Division of Human Rights (NYSDHR) or in New York State Supreme Court. NYSDHR's main office contact information is:  NYS Division of Human Rights, One Fordham Plaza, Fourth Floor, Bronx, New York 10458\\. You can also call (718) 741-8400 or visit: [http://www.dhr.ny.gov](http://www.dhr.ny.gov).   \n    \n* Team members working in New York City may file complaints alleging violation of the New York City Human Rights Law with the New York City Commission on Human Rights (NYCCHR) or in New York State Supreme Court.  NYCCHR\u2019s main office contact information is:  Law Enforcement Bureau of the NYC Commission on Human Rights, 40 Rector Street, 10th Floor, New York, New York; you can also call 311 or (212) 306-7450 or visit [www.nyc.gov/html/cchr/html/home/home.shtml](http://www.nyc.gov/html/cchr/html/home/home.shtml).\n\n\nOther states and local jurisdictions may have additional protections against sexual and other harassment and discrimination.  team members can contact the state, county, city or town in which they live to find out if such a law exists.  \n\nUnder the applicable employment discrimination laws, there are different deadlines for filing complaints with the different government agencies and courts.  If unlawful harassment is found to have occurred, government agencies and courts may be able to provide various remedies, such as requiring an employer to take appropriate action to stop the harassment and awarding monetary damages and attorney\u2019s fees.\n\nNo Retaliation  \nRetaliation against or harassment of individuals who oppose any unlawful practice under the employment discrimination laws, in good faith file complaints, or truthfully assist or participate in an investigation or proceeding involving sexual or other harassment or discrimination, is unlawful and prohibited by Uniswap Labs.  No one will be subject to any form of discipline, reprisal, intimidation, harassment or retaliation for good faith reporting or complaints of incidents of harassment, discrimination or any other violation of this policy or the law, or for pursuing any harassment or discrimination claim, assisting another individual to report harassment or discrimination, or testifying or cooperating in related investigations or other proceedings.  Any such retaliation or harassment should be reported, and team members found to be engaging in such unlawful conduct will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\n\nResponsibilities of Managers  \nAll managers who receive a complaint or information about suspected sexual or other discriminatory harassment, observe what may be harassing behavior, or for any reason suspect that there may be harassment or any other violation of this policy, are required to report such suspected harassment or violation to a member of the People team.\n\nIn addition to being subject to discipline if they engaged in sexually harassing conduct or other harassing conduct themselves, managers will be subject to discipline for failing to report suspected sexual harassment or other discriminatory harassment, or otherwise knowingly allowing sexual harassment or other harassment to continue.\n\nManagers will also be subject to discipline for engaging in any retaliation.",

We also provide reasonable accommodations to our team members related to pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions. \n\nUniswap Labs will engage in an interactive process with an applicant or employee to identify and explore possible reasonable accommodations for the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of the job, unless undue hardship would result. We may require medical certification of both the disability and the need for accommodation.  Keep in mind that Uniswap Labs can only seek to accommodate the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified disabled individual. Therefore, it is your responsibility to come forward if you are in need of an accommodation.  \n\nUniswap Labs will also engage in an interactive process, as outlined below, to explore and provide reasonable accommodations for other needs that would allow the employee to perform the essential functions of the job without creating an undue hardship for Uniswap Labs, including for needs related to the following:\n\n* Pregnancy, childbirth or a related medical condition, which may include bathroom breaks, breaks to facilitate increased water intake, periodic rest (for team members who stand for prolonged periods), and/or an unpaid leave of absence.\n\n\n* Domestic violence, sex offenses or stalking, a leave to seek medical attention or psychological counseling for the employee or the employee\u2019s child; obtain services from a domestic violence shelter, program or rape crisis center; participate in safety planning, including relocation; or attend to legal matters.\n\n\n* A sincerely held religious belief, practice or observance, which may include adjustments to work schedules or modifications to certain workplace policies.  \n\nIf you would like to make an accommodation request, please ask your manager or your People Business Partner.

However, if an employee cannot give 30 days\u2019 advance notice due to the need to use PDL being unforeseeable, the employee must provide as much notice as is practicable.\n\nOther Non-Leave Rights Related to Pregnancy Disability  \nAn eligible employee who experiences a qualifying event may request a reasonable accommodation, including transfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position (where one is available) or duties if it is medically advisable because of pregnancy-related disability.  The notice requirement described above applies equally to these non-leave rights.  An employee who takes PDL or is granted a transfer as a reasonable accommodation normally will be able to return to the same or comparable position with the same status, pay, length of service credit and seniority as on the date that the leave or reasonable accommodation commenced.\n\nDocumentation  \nThe employee must provide Uniswap Labs with a certification from a health care provider verifying the need for PDL. The certification should contain:\n\n* The date on which the employee became disabled due to pregnancy;  \n* The probable duration of the period or periods of disability; and  \n* A statement that, due to the disability, the employee is unable to perform one or more of the essential functions of her position without undue risk to herself, the successful completion of her pregnancy, or to other persons.\n\n| How We Work  |\n| :---: |\n\n![][image2]",

If at any time an employee feels they are being coerced into working through a meal period or take a late meal period (i.e., beginning the first meal period after completing 5 hours of work in the shift or beginning a second meal period after completing 10 hours of work in the shift) should promptly speak with their supervisor and/or the People team.  \n\nRest Periods  \nNon-exempt employees are entitled, expected and encouraged to take 10-minute uninterrupted, paid rest periods for every 4 hours worked or major fraction thereof, as summarized below:\n\n| Duration of Shift in Hours | \\# 30-Minute Meal Periods |\n| ----- | :---: |\n| Less than or equal to 3.5 hours | 0 |\n| More than 3.5 hours but  Less than or equal to 6 hours | 1 |\n| More than 6 hours but Less than or equal to 10 hours | 2 |\n| More than 10 hours but Less than or equal to 14 hours\\[2\\] | 3 |\n\n*\\[2\\]Covered Employees who work more than 14 hours in a shift may be entitled to additional rest periods in accordance with California law.*\n\nWhenever practicable, employees should take their rest periods near the middle of each four-hour work period during the shift.

We don\u2019t require anyone to come into the office if their preference is for remote working, but we encourage team members to go into the NY office as often as possible, especially new hires for a week in the first month.

Our Unlimited Paid Time Off (PTO) policy means that, while there is no maximum number of days off you can reasonably be approved to take off, you should take time off in a way that is not disruptive to the business. Our team historically averages around 4 weeks per year as the norm. The calendar year for purposes of this policy is January 1 through December 31\\. \n\nWhat\u2019s included in PTO:\n\n* Vacation  \n* Sick leave  \n* Bereavement leave  \n* Birthday reprieve   \n* Any other time you may just need a break\n\nUniswap also has an annual end of year break. Refer to the current year's holiday schedule for exact dates.\n\nWe encourage all of our team members to utilize this benefit to prioritize holistic care for themselves and those around them. As a team, however, we hold responsibility to each other and ourselves, so we expect our team members to exercise good judgment on when and how to use their PTO. \n\nTaking PTO\n\nFor planned absences, such as for vacation or other known events, team members should request PTO from their Manager and record the time off by using the PTO by Deel app in the Uniswap Labs\u2019s Slack as far in advance as possible. Generally, one week\u2019s notice for your manager for every day you are taking off is the minimum, and more notice is always better.\n\nEligibility and Pay  \nAll regular full-time team members are eligible for PTO. Temporary team members and regular part-time team members scheduled to work less than 20 hours per week are not eligible for PTO but are provided with sick time if required by the law applicable in the state or city where the employee works.    \nPTO days will be paid at the employee\u2019s base rate of pay at the time of the absence, excluding any other forms of compensation such as bonuses and overtime.  \n\nPTO Considerations\n\n* PTO is not intended for extended personal leaves; please speak to your manager or People team People Team to inquire about an extended leave longer than two consecutive weeks.\n\n* If you are unable to request PTO in advance due to an emergency or unforeseen circumstances, you are expected to notify your Manager as soon as possible.\n\n* An employee\u2019s failure to follow the procedures above may result in Uniswap Labs not approving the use of PTO for the absence.  As a result, you may be denied time off or may have to take the time off without pay and/or be disciplined for taking unexcused time off.\n\n* Uniswap Labs will generally grant reasonable requests for PTO for vacation/personal day purposes when possible, taking business needs into consideration. However, Uniswap Labs reserves the right to deny PTO requests for such purposes in its sole discretion. There is no guarantee that any particular PTO request will be approved (except as may be required under applicable law, including state or local sick leave laws).  Approval will not be given for PTO days under certain circumstances (e.g., where the employee is on a performance improvement plan, after the employee has provided notice of their intent to leave Uniswap Labs and/or if the employee has given two (2) weeks\u2019 notice and requests PTO for the last two (2) weeks of employment).  \n\n* Since Uniswap Labs has an unlimited PTO policy and PTO is not earned or accrued, there will be no pay-out of PTO or vacation upon separation from employment for any reason, except where required otherwise by law. \n\n* We prohibit discrimination or retaliation against any employee for taking PTO for Sick Leave Purposes.",

The law mandates extensive new workplace health and safety protections in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of the NY HERO Act is to protect employees against exposure and disease during a future airborne infectious disease outbreak. \n\nUnder this law, the New York State Department of Labor (NYS DOL), in consultation with the NYS Department of Health, has developed an Airborne Infectious Disease Exposure Prevention Standard, a Model Airborne Infectious Disease Exposure Prevention Plan, and various industry-specific model plans for the prevention of airborne infectious disease. Employers can choose to adopt the applicable policy template/plan provided by NYS DOL or establish an alternative plan that meets or exceeds the standard\u2019s minimum requirements.\n\nThe airborne infectious disease exposure prevention plans must go into effect when an airborne infectious disease is designated by the New York State Commissioner of Health as a highly contagious communicable disease that presents a serious risk of harm to the public health. When designated, employers are required to provide a copy of the adopted airborne infectious disease exposure prevention plan and post the same in a visible and prominent location within each worksite. Templates and resources are available below. \n\nOn March 17, 2022, the designation of COVID-19 as an airborne infectious disease that presents a serious risk of harm to the public health under the HERO Act ended. Private sector employers are no longer required to implement their workforce safety plans.\n\nInquiries about the HERO Act can be emailed to Airborne.Infectious.Diseases@labor.ny.gov.",

We know that our team members do best when they feel supported outside of the workplace, so we want to ensure that we do our best to help make your transition into parenthood a joyous one\\!\n\nThe Uniswap Parental Leave Policy is a paid leave benefit provided to Eligible team members (as defined below) who are unable to work due to pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions and/or who wish to take time off from work to bond with a new child. Birthing mothers will be entitled to up to 16 weeks (4 months) with all other parents entitled up to 12 weeks (3 months). \n\nRegular full-time team members are eligible for this policy on their first day of employment. Other team members (i.e., temporary team members and part-time team members) are not entitled to leave or benefits under this policy but are provided with leave, pay and accommodations in accordance with Uniswap Labs\u2019 other policies and all applicable laws. \n\nQualifying Leave  \nUniswap Parental Leave commences upon the birth of a child or upon the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care and must be used concurrently with any other leave or benefits for which the employee is eligible (e.g., short-term disability leave or state paid family leave benefits) within 12 months of the child\u2019s birth or placement. This includes any period of disability occasioned by an employee\u2019s inability to perform the essential functions of her job, with or without a reasonable accommodation, due to pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, and any period of leave taken by an employee to bond with a new child, including foster and adoptive children. Please note that other leave and benefits may be available to team members before or after the Uniswap Parental Leave period.  \n\nPay and Benefits; Increments of Use  \nDuring the Uniswap Parental Leave period, subject to fulfilling all requirements, team members will receive their regular base pay (which may be paid in part by short term disability or paid family leave benefits), and Uniswap Labs will continue to provide group health benefits (and team members will be required to continue making any required contributions) on the same terms as if the employee had not taken leave. Uniswap Parental Leave may be taken on an intermittent (non-consecutive) basis with the approval of the employee\u2019s manager and a member of the People Operations team, or to the extent an employee is entitled to intermittent leave under applicable law. An intermittent leave will require a detailed plan of when the team member will be on leave vs working and include the desired length of each part of the leave used. The People Team and the employees manager will review and approve.\n\nConcurrent Leave and Benefits  \nUniswap Parental Leave runs concurrently with (and includes) any other leave or benefits for which the employee may be eligible under federal or state laws or other Uniswap Labs benefits, including without limitation short-term disability leave and state paid family leave benefits, to the extent permitted by such plans and policies.  The pay benefits provided by Uniswap Labs under this policy will supplement any pay benefits to which the employee may be entitled, and in no case will pay from all sources exceed 100% of the employee\u2019s regular base salary.  \n\nHow to Apply for Leave  \nWhen the need for leave is foreseeable, team members should give at least 30 days\u2019 notice of the request for leave. If 30 days\u2019 notice is not possible due to medical necessity or for other reasons, you should provide as much notice as possible. team members will be required to apply for all benefits and leaves for which they are eligible (such as short-term disability or paid family leave benefits).  Please speak to the People Team for details.\n\nReasonable Accommodation  \nAll team members, including those who are not eligible for Uniswap Parental Leave, who need reasonable accommodation (which may include leave) for pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, refer to the [Reasonable Accommodations](#reasonable-accommodations:-disability,-nursing-mothers-and-religious) section.\n\nReturn to Work  \nDuring Uniswap Parental Leave, your job will be held for you in accordance with applicable law.  Please note that team members have no greater right to reinstatement under this policy than if they had been continuously employed rather than on leave.    \nNothing in this policy affects your status as an at-will employee. Uniswap Labs prohibits discrimination or retaliation against any employee for taking Uniswap Parental Leave.  If you have any questions, please speak to a member of the People Ops team.\n\nOur parental leave policy complements, and will not contradict the [New York State Paid Family Leave (NYPFL)](https://paidfamilyleave.ny.gov/) and the [Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla). If you need further clarification on these policies, consult our People Ops Leader and/or either of the policies mentioned in this handbook.\n\nPaid Family Leave  \nThis particular policy applies only to team members working in New York State, as this benefit is administered by the state and paid for by payroll deductions from New York team members.  team members working in certain states outside of New York may be eligible for similar-type benefits *IF* their state has such a benefit. Please speak to the People Ops team to inquire if such a benefit is available in your state.  \n\nNew York Paid Family Leave  \nUnder the New York Paid Family Leave Benefits Law (\u201cPFL\u201d), team members in New York State may be eligible to take partially paid leave from work for the following:\n\n* To bond with a new child within 12 months of the child\u2019s birth or placement with the employee for adoption or foster care.    \n* To provide care, including physical or psychological care, for the employee\u2019s family member with a serious health condition.  \n* To attend to \u201cqualifying exigencies\u201d as defined under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act, arising out of the fact that the employee\u2019s spouse, domestic partner, child or parent in the US military is on covered active duty abroad or is called to active duty abroad.\n\nPFL benefits are generally not available for an employee\u2019s own serious health condition (except for certain limited situations for certain team members when the employee is under an order of quarantine or isolation due to COVID-19).  For purposes of this policy, the following definitions apply:\n\n* \u201cFamily member\u201d means an employee\u2019s parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, spouse or domestic partner. Beginning on January 1, 2023, \u201cfamily member\u201d will also include siblings.  \n* \u201cSerious health condition\u201d means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves (i) inpatient care in a hospital, hospice or residential health care facility, or (ii) continuing treatment or continuing supervision by a health care provider, including but not limited to preparation for and recovery from surgery related to organ or tissue donation.    \n* \u201cQualifying exigency\u201d has the meaning as it is defined under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act and includes, for example, attending to child care or parental care arrangements, financial and legal arrangements, counseling, military events, post-deployment events, and spending time with a covered military family member on short-term Rest and Recuperation leave.\n\nDuration of Leave and Increments of Use  \nThe PFL law provides for up to 12 weeks of leave in a 52-week period. The 52-week period is a \u201crolling\u201d 52-week period measured backward with respect to each day for which PFL benefits are claimed. Leave may be taken on an intermittent basis in increments of one full day (or one fifth of the weekly benefit).\n\nEligibility and Payroll Deductions  \nTeam members who work 20 or more hours per week are eligible after completing 26 consecutive weeks of employment. Team members who work less than 20 hours per week are eligible after 175 days of employment. PFL benefits are financed through payroll deductions, which may begin prior to the commencement of coverage, in accordance with New York State law. Team members whose work schedules will not allow the employee to become eligible for PFL coverage will be offered the option to be exempted from payroll deductions for PFL coverage and waive PFL benefits by completing [this form](http://docs.paidfamilyleave.ny.gov/content/main/forms/PFLDocs/PFLWaiver.pdf) and providing it to a member of the People Ops team.  \n\nPay and Benefits During PFL  \nDuring PFL, team members receive a certain percentage of their average weekly wage, up to a cap of the New York State Average Weekly Wage (\u201cNYSAWW\u201d).  For leave commencing effective January 1, 2021, eligible team members will receive 67% of their average weekly wage, up to a cap of 67% of the NYSAWW.  During the leave, Uniswap Labs will maintain an employee\u2019s group health insurance coverage on the same terms as if the employee had not taken leave, and the employee will be required to continue making contributions on the same terms as if he or she had not taken leave.  \n\nHow to Apply for PFL  \nIf the need for leave is foreseeable, team members must give Uniswap Labs at least 30 days\u2019 written notice before the date that the leave is expected to begin, or, if not foreseeable, as soon as practicable.  Failure to provide timely notice may result in a delay or partial denial of benefits.  An employee who seeks to use PFL will be required to submit a claim form to Guardian (through Sequoia), the Uniswap Labs\u2019s PFL insurance carrier, along with documentation supporting their need for leave (e.g., birth certificate, medical certification or military deployment papers).  Please contact a member of the People Ops team for the required forms.  Forms are also available from the Uniswap Labs\u2019s PFL insurance carrier and from the New York State website [here](http://www.ny.gov/new-york-state-paid-family-leave/paid-family-leave-forms-team%20members-employers-and-insurance-carriers). \n\nUpon an employee\u2019s return from PFL, to the full extent required by law Uniswap Labs will reinstate the employee to the employee\u2019s original position or, if no longer available, to an equivalent position with equivalent terms and conditions of employment, including pay and employment benefits, in accordance with applicable law; provided that an employee returning from PFL has no greater right to reinstatement than if the employee had been continuously employed.  Retaliation against an employee who requests or takes PFL is strictly prohibited.  \n\nCoordination of PFL with Other Leaves  \nTo the extent that an employee\u2019s leave qualifies for both PFL and any other leave(s), PFL will run concurrently with all other leaves, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and policies.  To the extent that team members are eligible for both short-term disability benefits and PFL benefits during the same period, team members may not concurrently receive both benefits (except in certain limited situations related to COVID-19).  An employee\u2019s combined short-term disability benefits and PFL benefits may not exceed 26 weeks in the same 52-week period.    \nPTO may not be used concurrently to supplement PFL benefits.\n\nCalifornia Family Right Acts Leave  \nThis policy is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of the California Family Rights Act (\u201cCFRA\u201d) provisions governing parental leave.  \n\nEligibility  \nA California-based employee is eligible for a leave under this policy if he or she (i) has worked for Uniswap Labs for at least 12 months prior to the date on which the leave is to commence; and (ii) has worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period preceding the leave.  \n\nLeave Entitlement  \nCFRA leave may be up to 12 workweeks in a 12-month period, within any 12-month rolling period, for any of the following reasons:\n\n* The birth, adoption, or foster care placement of your child.  \n* To care for your own serious health condition.  \n* To care for the serious health condition of your child, spouse, domestic partner, parent, including parent-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling.  \n* a qualifying exigency related to the covered active duty or call to covered active duty of an employee's spouse, domestic partner, child, or parent, including parent-in-law in the US Armed Forces. \n\nNotice  \nAn employee must provide at least 30 days\u2019 advance notice of departure.  However, if an employee cannot give 30 days\u2019 advance notice due to circumstances beyond his or her control, the employee may provide less notice as long as the employee provides as much notice as is practicable.\n\nReturning to Work  \nUpon an employee\u2019s return from PFL, Uniswap Labs will reinstate the employee to his or her original position or, if no longer available, to an equivalent position with equivalent terms and conditions of employment, including pay and employment benefits, in accordance with applicable law. Use of PFL cannot result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued before the start of PFL that was not used during the leave.\n\nNon-Retaliation & Additional Information  \nThe Uniswap Labs prohibits discrimination or retaliation against an employee who requests or takes leave under this policy.

As with any situation, please use good judgment to maintain a high standard of ethics and integrity as a Uniswap Labs employee.  \nThese guidelines address common activities where conflicts may arise and outline a process for team members to clear any potential conflicts with the Uniswap Labs legal team. \n\nPotential conflicts include: \n\n1. Advisor Roles and Outside Employment  \n   Uniswap Labs supports team members in working on companies and projects outside of Uniswap Labs as directors, advisors, or contributors, with certain limitations as long as:   \n   * The company or project doesn\u2019t directly or indirectly compete with the business or the interests of Uniswap Labs  \n   * The activities are unrelated to your role and work at Uniswap Labs  \n   * The activities do not interfere with your performance and duties at Uniswap Labs. \n\n   If the outside company or project doesn\u2019t meet any of these criteria, or takes more than 5 hours per week, please follow the [Clearing Process](#how-to-clear-any-potential-conflicts-of-interest:). \n\n2. Outside Investments and Trading  \n   When you have confidential or sensitive information about Uniswap Labs and you want to trade a digital asset or other types of property, please follow the [Uniswap Labs Non-Public Information Trading Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K5xxuQ4Wm0oM-tN8Ll1JNlo4ZcmXzj0aXP9Fpcsvj1I/edit).   \n   Note: If you are actively involved in Uniswap Labs\u2019 venture investment workstreams, you may not invest in any blockchain or crypto-based project unless it has (1) already been vetted by Uniswap Labs Ventures, and (2) you have followed the [Clearing Process](#how-to-clear-any-potential-conflicts-of-interest:).  \n     \n     \n     \n3. Employment Decisions   \n   You may not influence any decision to hire, compensate, or dismiss any person or employee to whom you have family, romantic, or other pre-existing social relationship without first disclosing your relationship through the [Clearing Process](#how-to-clear-any-potential-conflicts-of-interest:) and following the [Hiring Family Members guidelines below.](#hiring-family-members)   \n     \n4. Confidential Information  \n   You may not disclose confidential information about Uniswap Labs or about any third parties that you may learn as part of your employment at Uniswap Labs.  \n     \n5. Excessive Gifting  \n   Please don\u2019t offer or accept substantial gifts, entertainment, favors, payments, or tokens/ assets, from partners, other crypto projects, or anyone else if it could give the appearance of undue influence or otherwise be improper or embarrassing to Uniswap Labs. You may not give or accept anything from any foreign official, politician, or political candidate in your capacity as an employee of Uniswap Labs (this does not limit lawful personal political contributions).   \n   Note: If you would like to give or receive anything over $200 in connection with your role at Uniswap Labs, please follow the [Clearing Process](#how-to-clear-any-potential-conflicts-of-interest:) first. \n\n### How to clear any potential conflicts of interest: {#how-to-clear-any-potential-conflicts-of-interest:}\n\nIf you are unsure whether an activity, transaction or relationship might result in a conflict of interest, please raise the potential conflict of interest to the legal team for additional insight and clearance.   \nFirst, email [legal@uniswap.org](mailto:legal@uniswap.org) and include the following: \n\n* details about the potential conflict, including the nature of the activity  \n* the amount of any investment involved  \n* the amount of time you are involved with the activity  \n* whether you are or the activity is affiliated with Uniswap Labs Ventures\n\nNext, the legal team will work with others (your manager, and/or the executive team) to review the activity and assess whether there is a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest. The legal team may ask you questions regarding the activity and your work for Uniswap Labs as a part of this process.\n\nFinally, the legal team will follow up with you in writing via email with a determination as to whether the activity is approved or not and will endeavor to do so within seven days.\n\nFailure to follow these guidelines may result in discipline, including termination. The guidelines in this document do not limit any of your rights under law, including Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, or prohibit you from filing a complaint with, or otherwise cooperating with or participating in any government investigation or proceeding involving Uniswap Labs.",

Due to potential for perceived or actual conflicts, such as favoritism or personal conflicts from outside the work environment, Uniswap Labs will hire relatives of team members only if: a) candidates will not be working directly for or supervising a relative, and b) candidates will not occupy a position in the same line of authority in which team members can initiate or participate in decisions involving a direct benefit to the relative. Such decisions include hiring, retention, transfer, promotion, wages and leave requests.\n\n\"Family member\" is defined as one of the following: spouse or significant other, parent/step parent, child/step child, grandparent, grandchild, brother/brother-in-law, sister/sister-in-law, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, first cousin, in-laws (father, mother, son daughter).\n\nProcedure  \nPrior to the employment offer, the Hiring Manager must complete a signed statement certifying that the candidate for employment is a relative as defined above. Failure to submit the signed statement to the People Team will result in the delay of the job offer until the statement is submitted. The Hiring Manager is responsible for ensuring policy compliance and for monitoring changes in employee reporting relations after initial hire. Team members are responsible for immediately reporting any changes to their Hiring Manager.\n\nIf any employee, after employment or change in employment, enters into one of the above relationships, one of the affected individuals must seek a transfer or a change in the reporting relationship. Such changes must be approved by the People Team. If a decision cannot be made by the affected team members within 14 days of reporting, reassignment will be made on direction of the team director and the People Team.",

This policy applies to conduct on Uniswap Labs premises at any time (whether or not the employee is working) and to conduct during work hours, including paid and unpaid breaks and meal periods (whether or not on premises) or while on Uniswap Labs business (whether or not on premises).  Any Uniswap Labs reference to controlled substances in this policy or otherwise shall include marijuana, including physician-prescribed marijuana, unless otherwise stated.    \nWith one exception as described below, the following are strictly prohibited by Uniswap Labs:\n\n1. The possession or use, or being under the influence of, alcohol, illegal drugs, or a controlled substance while on the job, unless the use of the controlled substance is consistent with a physician\u2019s prescription that is lawful under federal and state law and does not impair the employee\u2019s ability to work satisfactorily or pose a risk to workplace safety.\n\n2. Driving a Uniswap Labs-provided vehicle (whether or not the employee is working) or driving on business (whether or not in a Uniswap Labs-provided vehicle) while under the influence of alcohol, illegal drugs, or a controlled substance; and\n\n3. Distribution, dispensation, sale, or purchase of an illegal or controlled substance while on the job. \n\nThe one exception to this policy is the moderate, responsible consumption of alcohol at a Uniswap Labs sponsored event that does not impair the employee\u2019s judgment or performance;  however, under no circumstances may an employee drive while under the influence of alcohol, and team members must make *prior* arrangements for safe, alternate transportation from the event.\n\nMarijuana/Cannabis. While marijuana has been legalized in some states, including New York, for medical and/or recreational use, it remains an illegal drug under federal law, and its use as it impacts the workplace is prohibited. Except where permitted by applicable law, Uniswap Labs does not discriminate against team members solely on the basis of their off-duty and off-site use without use of any Uniswap Labs equipment or other property of (i) medical marijuana in compliance with state medical marijuana laws, or (ii) recreational marijuana in compliance with state recreational marijuana laws.    \nIf an employee has a medical condition that qualifies as a \u201cdisability\u201d under applicable law (including but not limited to New York team members with a serious condition who have been issued a patient certification and registry identification card for the use of medical marijuana under the New York Public Health Law, Sections 3360-3369-E), the employee may seek a reasonable accommodation to allow them to perform the essential functions of their job that does not pose an undue hardship to Uniswap Labs.  To request a reasonable accommodation for a medical condition that qualifies as a \u201cdisability\u201d under applicable law,  please see the [Uniswap Labs\u2019s policy on Reasonable Accommodations for Disabilities, Pregnancy, Religious Observances and Needs Related to Domestic Violence, Sex Offenses or Stalking](#reasonable-accommodations:-disability,-nursing-mothers-and-religious).\n\nTeam members are encouraged to notify their managers in advance if their use of any over-the-counter medication or properly prescribed drug may affect their work performance.    \nViolation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

This prohibition includes payments to third parties where you know, or have reason to know, that the third party will use any part of the payment for bribes or other corrupt payments.\n\nUnless permitted by this Policy or by written approval from the Legal Team, no offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization to pay or provide any money, gifts, entertainment, travel, or anything else of value will be made, solicited, or accepted, by or on behalf of the Company, to or from any person, including any Foreign Official.  These prohibitions apply to payments or offers to pay or give anything of value, whether or not they involve the use of corporate resources (*e.g.*, personal expenditure or entertainment).\n\n### (b)       \t*Cash Payments*\n\nCash payments of any kind to a third party, other than documented petty cash disbursements or other valid and approved payments, are prohibited.  Company checks shall not be written to \u201ccash,\u201d \u201cbearer,\u201d or anyone other than the party entitled to payment, except to replenish properly used petty cash funds.\n\n### (c)        \t*Hospitality*\n\nThe FCPA permits certain payments for reasonable and bona fide expenses that are *directly related* to the promotion, demonstration, or explanation of the Company\u2019s products and services.  As such, the Company abides by the following practices:\n\n* Any travel or entertainment expenses must be limited solely to those individuals necessary for the furtherance of the Company\u2019s business.  No payments can be authorized for travel or entertainment expenses for spouses or guests.  \n* All travel and entertainment expenses must be accurately and adequately documented in the books and records of the Company, including the purpose or value of these expenses.  \n* Legitimate gifts, meals, and entertainment are permitted only if they are of nominal value, infrequent, and not offered for an improper purpose.  Prior approval from the Legal Team is required for all gifts, meals, and entertainment with a value of greater than $50.\n\nAny proposed provision of travel or lodging must be described in writing to the Legal Team, who alone has the authority to approve the request.\n\n### (d)       \t*Facilitation Payments*\n\nThe Company prohibits \u201cfacilitation payments\u201d (*i.e.*, small payments to facilitate routine, non-discretionary government functions), which are illegal under the anti-corruption laws of many other countries.\n\n### (e)        \t*Political and Charitable Contributions*\n\nUnless permitted by written approval from the Legal Team, no money, assets, property, or other thing of value of the Company may be contributed, loaned, or made available to any candidate, party, or political committee.\n\nUnder no circumstances may charitable contributions be made at the suggestion, request, or at the behest of any Foreign Official to obtain any improper advantage or to a charity owned, controlled, or connected to a Foreign Official.\n\n### (f)         \t*Books, Records, and Accounting*\n\nThe Company maintains books and accounting records that accurately reflect all transactions in reasonable detail.  These recordkeeping requirements apply to all payments (including the types described above), not merely those that would be material in the traditional financial sense.\n\nOfficers, directors, employees, contractors, and third parties are prohibited from manipulating books or records in an effort to mask transactions, either by characterizing them in some oblique way or by omitting them from the Company\u2019s books or records entirely.  Accordingly, no undisclosed or unrecorded accounts may be maintained for any purpose.\n\n### (g)        \t*Relationships with Agents and Other Third Parties*\n\nThe Company strictly prohibits using an agent, consultant, intermediary, or other third party acting on the Company\u2019s behalf to make a payment or gift that would be prohibited by our Policy if made by the Company or its employees.  The actions of third parties present particular risks because, in certain circumstances, the Company and its employees can be held liable for improper payments made by a third party, even if the Company did not have actual knowledge of the payment.      \n\n# 5\\.          \tAnti-Money Laundering (AML) Laws\n\nMoney laundering is the process by which those involved in criminal activities conceal the source of and disguise the nature of illicit funds by making them appear legitimate.  The Company is not a financial institution required under AML Laws to maintain a formal anti-money laundering policy.  But because participating in or facilitating a financial transaction that involves the proceeds of illegal activity may constitute a money laundering crime, the Company\u2019s policy is not to facilitate money laundering.  Although the Company does not conduct any special diligence to determine the source fund of its investors or other counterparties, the Company reserves the right to refuse to do business with any person, including as a vendor or person providing financing to or an investment in the Company, if the Company believes that such person presents a money laundering risk.  In particular, the Company may refuse to conduct business with any person that it has reason to believe is not engaged in a legitimate business (including persons whose funds are directly or indirectly proceeds of crime) or does not have a legitimate source of wealth. \n\nIn the event that the Company is required to refund or otherwise to return or distribute funds, it is the Company\u2019s policy to make the payment of the amount due to the same person that made the initial payment or investment and to the same account or payment method by which the original payment, or from which the original investment, was made, unless the Company receives a satisfactory explanation for some other payment procedure.  The Company\u2019s policy is to make payments to third parties only (i) in exchange for legitimate products, services, and/or property provided to the Company having a value equivalent to the amount paid; (ii) in satisfaction of the Company\u2019s legal obligations; or (iii) in connection with distributions to the Company\u2019s investors.\n\n# 6\\.          \tEmployee Obligations",

        "content": "## OFAC Sanctions and Trade Compliance Program \n\nOFAC administers and enforces U.S. economic and trade sanctions programs against specific comprehensively sanctioned jurisdictions (listed above), as well as targeted foreign governments, individuals, groups, economic sectors, and entities around the world in accordance with national security and foreign policy goals and objectives. While many of the listed prohibited parties are concentrated in jurisdictions of known concern to the U.S. Government (such as Russia, Belarus, China, and Venezuela), there are some parties resident in almost all countries in the world who appear on the \u201cblacklist\u201d (formally the \u201cSpecially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List\u201d or the \u201cSDN List\u201d), which is managed and principally enforced by OFAC.  \n   \nOFAC has an important law enforcement and national security function working to leverage and protect U.S. global power through its work on counter-terrorism, anti-money laundering, and sanctions. OFAC and the broader Treasury Department \u2013 including its sister agency, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Center (FinCEN) \u2013 closely scrutinize new technologies or entities that could threaten American national security through failure to comply with its regulations. Similarly, potential partners or mainstream investors in Uniswap will avoid the company if we do not have a Sanctions and Trade Compliance Program (STCP) to appropriately address our compliance risk profile.\n\n   \nFinally, in addition to corporate regulatory risk, our employees face personal risk if they are found to facilitate financing for terrorists or rogue regimes or otherwise act in violation of OFAC regulations. Entities and individuals who the U.S. Government deems to have violated these regulations \u2013 by impermissibly undertaking or facilitating transactions with blocked entities or jurisdictions \u2013 face significant civil and criminal liabilities, including the potential for substantial fines and, if violations are deemed serious enough, even incarceration. Importantly, individuals and companies can face civil consequences (fines) under a strict liability theory \u2013 violative actions do not need to be significant *nor purposeful* in order to be subjected to regulatory consequences.\n\n   \nOFAC expects companies involved with digital assets, such as Uniswap, to adopt a \u201crisk-based\u201d approach to compliance. See [OFAC Sanctions Compliance Guidance for the Virtual Currency Industry](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/virtual_currency_guidance_brochure.pdf).  As such, our approach to compliance should take into account our business model, as well as what we understand to be the fast-changing regulatory environment.  \n   \nOFAC\u2019s \u201crisk-based\u201d expectation means that there is no one-size-fits all approach to complying with the agency\u2019s regulations (and related FinCEN regulations and export restrictions administered by the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)). Rather, OFAC encourages an organization subject to U.S. jurisdiction, such as Uniswap, to employ a \u201crisk-based approach to sanctions compliance\u201d by developing, implementing, and routinely updating its STCP. According to OFAC\u2019s Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), a risk-based approach for compliance in the cryptocurrency arena is similar to one for fiat currency. Indeed, OFAC\u2019s limited guidance on cryptocurrency suggests that the obligations for entities dealing with cryptocurrency are identical to those dealing with fiat currency. In fact, OFAC jurisdiction is not triggered by the exchange of currency \u2013 but rather by the undertaking of any dealing in which anything of value (including a service) is provided to, by, or through a counterparty. Generally, if a counterparty is restricted (due to their location in a comprehensively sanctioned jurisdiction or presence on the SDN List), any undertaking with it is prohibited regardless the means, mechanism or denomination of the exchange. If there is a violation, OFAC will consider as an important mitigation in its assessment of appropriate enforcement actions if an alleged violator had an appropriate STCP at the time of the apparent violation. Uniswap therefore analyzes the risks of sanctions violations below and has tailored its sanctions compliance program in keeping with those risks and OFAC\u2019s approach to enforcement.  \n   \nBecause Uniswap deals with novel financial products on which OFAC and other agencies have been concentrating, our risks are somewhat elevated (compared with an offline enterprise for example). According to [OFAC guidance](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/framework_ofac_cc.pdf) released in May 2019, companies should consider the risks of \u201cusing the U.S. financial system\u201d or \u201cprocessing payments\u201d for OFAC-sanctioned entities, individuals and jurisdictions. While Uniswap is not formally part of the traditional financial system nor does it *generally* process payments, it does permit the exchange of value between parties unrelated to Uniswap. Consequently, that is the key risk that needs to be addressed and managed via the STCP.  \n   \nUniswap\u2019s risk across the Protocol, the Token, and the Interface differ and consequently the STCP provides that appropriate risk-based compliance is also different across these products.  \n   \n1\\. \tOn the Protocol, we should be willing to provide proactive education to law enforcement and policy makers and to direct such law enforcement and policy makers to blockchain analytics consultants and experts or engage a consultant directly to help with reactive technical diligence.  \n   \n2\\. \tOn the Token, when we are involved in token transactions, such as directly paying someone in tokens, Uniswap should engage in appropriate risk-based measures including, as necessary, adhering to the Uniswap Policy on Compliance with Anti-Corruption and Anti-Money Laundering Laws.  \n   \n3\\. \tOn the Interface we should:  \na. geo-block all jurisdictions subject to comprehensive sanctions.  \nb. block all Ethereum addresses on the SDN List and file necessary reports to OFAC  if these addresses attempt to trade on the Interface.  \nc. continue to work with TRM Labs or others in the industry, to be able to respond to suspicious behavior identified on the Interface.  \n   \nAs noted, the Protocol, the Token, and Interface differ and different risk-based compliance is called for each offering. (One commonality between them is that none involves the sort of encryption requiring notice to the government authorities like the National Security Agency and BIS\u2014there\u2019s no encryption in the token or smart contract, as all the encryption is published in Ethereum.)  \n   \n**Protocol Compliance**  \nWith respect to the Protocol, it is \u201cpublicly available\u201d much like Linux and therefore our obligations are very limited. By definition, such software is \u201cavailable for download \\[or use\\] without restriction.\u201d The Protocol is an immutable code and we cannot block transactions or approve them. The relationship between Uniswap (or Universal Navigation, Inc.) and the Uniswap Protocol is similar to the relationships between (a) Vint Cerf and the Internet Protocol; (b) Tim Berners-Lee and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol; (c) Satoshi Nakamoto and the Bitcoin Protocol; (d) the Ethereum Foundation and the Ethereum protocol. As a general matter, none of these \u201cinventors\u201d control who uses the products they developed nor for what purpose. As a general matter, none of them is responsible for sanctions violations using their protocols. This remains true even though Bitcoin and Ethereum, like Uniswap, are financial protocols for transferring value. It remains the case even though both Satoshi and the Ethereum Foundation received compensation through retaining or early mining of protocol tokens.  \n   \nEven if our risk-based compliance obligations are limited with respect to the Protocol, we should be willing to proactively provide authorities with educational conversations and materials so that we can emphasize our commitment to compliance with the authorities and they, in turn, can gain a greater understanding of our operations and be able to address actors who are not taking their OFAC responsibilities seriously (including by providing Uniswap guidance, as needed, concerning appropriate compliance).\n\n   \nAt the same time, even if the mechanics of our appropriately risk-based compliance obligations with respect to the Interface are limited, they exist and compliance with OFAC regulations remains critical. The Interface may be analogous to a simple website, but websites have compliance obligations. Vint Cerf works for Google; Google\u2019s website complies with OFAC. Satoshi, as a non-U.S. person located outside of the United States, may not have co-direct compliance obligations with OFAC, but Coinbase, as a U.S. person, does. Open sourcing the Interface code does not change this requirement; WordPress is open source and websites using it must comply with OFAC. The IPFS/IPNS hosting does not change this calculus either, especially in light of our updating the codebase regularly and the pinning service. Indeed, such updating and pinning provides enough of a U.S. nexus that OFAC compliance obligations likely attach.  \n   \n**Token Compliance**  \nRegarding the Token, when we are involved in Token transactions, such as directly paying someone in tokens, we must engage in appropriate risk-based measures including, as necessary, AML/KYC (including OFAC).  \n   \n**Interface Compliance**  \nInterface compliance requires geo-blocking comprehensively sanctioned jurisdictions. If we do not block traders located in Iran on the Interface, for example, we could be seen as \u201cfacilitating\u201d prohibited transactions or impermissibly exporting financial services to Iran. As of the date of this message, sanctioned jurisdictions are listed above in TL;DR. We must block access to any IP address in those jurisdictions. We have asked Cloudflare to block these regions. Cloudflare can discard the IP addresses after screening. (OFAC recognizes that users can employ VPNs and that geo-blocking is imperfect; however, perfection  is not the goal. Risk-based compliance measures are the key and geo-blocking is considered an industry standard and best practice). We utilize TRM Labs for assistance in blocking comprehensively sanctioned regions (rather than countries), such as Crimea. The Crimea sanctions have been in place for more than five years and as such there is significant best practices in the market as to how to appropriately geo-block the region.  Currently TRM is also actively investigating and monitoring the Russia-Ukraine conflict and its impact on sanctions. TRM tracks Russian extremist groups, for instance, with links to the DNR region and is collaborating with Ukrainian authorities to surface links between blockchain addresses and sanctioned persons, entities, and countries.  \n   \nUniswap should block transactions involving any Ethereum addresses on the SDN List or otherwise connected to SDNs. These addresses are associated with sanctioned people. As of January 11, 2023, OFAC maintained 142 ETH addresses (2x duplicate addresses identified).  We should block them on the Uniswap Interface \u2013 and to the extent any party tries to transact with these addresses, the payment transfer must be blocked and reported to OFAC within 10 business days of the attempted transaction.\n\n   \nWe use TRM Wallet Screening to screen addresses that connect to the Interface in order to detect ownership and counterparty risk exposure related to sanctioned addresses and entities. When any address connects to the Interface, we send that address to TRM\u2019s API and TRM screens it based on a risk engine configured by Uniswap. TRM links addresses to sanctioned persons, sanctioned organizations, and entities in sanctioned jurisdictions.  The Trade Compliance Group or a law firm then uses the TRM data to assess the risks of identified addresses.  \n   \nTRM Labs checks for updates daily and helps ensure our blocking list is current.",
