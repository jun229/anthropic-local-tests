Team members working outside of New York State may be covered by different state-specific policies and benefits, and team members working in certain states may be provided with a state handbook supplement summarizing specific policies or benefits applicable in those states.  \n\nNeither this handbook nor any other communication whether oral or written, is intended in any way to create a contract of employment. Also, this handbook cannot address every situation that may arise in the workplace, and Uniswap Labs reserves the right to flexibly address unique situations.\n\n*We hope your employment with us will be mutually beneficial and rewarding.*   \n*Welcome to the team\\!* \n\n# A Letter from Hayden Adams \n\nUniswap Labs is unique because of our people. Ours is a performance-driven and collaborative culture. We hold ourselves to high standards and are passionate about the role we play in shaping web3 through infrastructure and products. Our goals are ambitious, and our leaders are empowered to build lean teams where each person has an opportunity to make a significant impact. Our team members are multifaceted, with plenty of interests outside work, as writers, parents, musicians, athletes, artists and more. We believe this is an important part of building a culture of creativity, which manifests through the novel products we deliver to the world. \n\n# At-Will Employment {#at-will-employment}\n\nEmployment with Uniswap Labs is \u201cat-will\u201d. This means that employment may be terminated at any time by the employee or Uniswap Labs with or without cause, and with or without advance notice. The at-will relationship includes the right to hire, transfer, promote, reclassify, layoff, discipline, terminate or change any term or condition of employment (except for at-will employment itself) at any time with or without cause or advance notice. Our policy of \u201cat will\u201d employment cannot be changed except by a formal written agreement specifically entered into for this purpose signed by a member of the executive team.  \n\nNeither this employee handbook, nor any policy or practice of Uniswap Labs, is intended to imply continued or guaranteed employment, or otherwise limit in any way the policy of at-will employment. In describing Uniswap Labs\u2019 policies and procedures, this handbook does not obligate Uniswap Labs to follow any particular procedure in the course of imposing discipline or terminating employment.\n\nOur goal is to have the best team possible, and this means having the best people possible. Your experience with Uniswap Labs should be mutually beneficial; of course we want to grow our Uniswap Labs, and we also want to foster the growth and development of all our team members. If we\u2019re not holding up our end of the bargain, make sure to let us know.\n\n# \n\n# Vision, Mission and Values\n\nOur Vision  \nWe envision a world where everyone exchanges value through fair, accessible markets on the internet. In this new economy, value is global, within reach, and flows to creators and contributors. Uniswap Labs builds foundational products and infrastructure to bring this vision to life. \n\nOur Mission  \nUnlock universal ownership and exchange.",

    "text": "## **Uniswap Principles | Uni-code**\n\n*Our Uniswap operating principles (Unicode) articulate who we are (our values) and how we work. They are our daily guideposts for how we interact with each other, our users, and our community.*\n\n**People First**\n\nWe believe easy, safe, fair value transfer on the internet can improve people\u2019s lives. Access, security and experience is the center of everything we do. By pursuing decentralization, interoperability, and durability we align with our users over the long-term, and win. Internally, people are our greatest asset, and we strive for an environment where everyone can make an incredible impact. We share direct, kind feedback so we can improve. When we advocate for an idea, a technical tradeoff, or a business goal, we start with why \u2014 why it\u2019s better for our user, our company.\n\n**Simple**\n\nOur craft is keeping it simple. In a complex field, we create clarity & simplicity. We write and build in human terms, understood by everyone. This shows up in the design and language of our user experience, across our code, and in how we speak to the world and each other. We are deliberate in the words and images we use.\n\n**Pink**\n\nWe love pink, conceptually and irl. Disrupting the status quo is fun. We hold each other accountable to do serious work \u2013 without taking ourselves too seriously. We love unicorns, and we bring whimsy into our experiments and our day-to-day.  The people-first, internet-native financial system we\u2019re building welcomes anyone.\n\n**Push Through Ambiguity Together**\n\nStartup life can be ambiguous \u2014 and especially at the frontier. We are at peace with the uncertainty. We push through resistance. We show up ready to explore new ideas. We have conviction that our mission is worth it. When things get hard, we stay on the same team. We create scalable solutions to make things less ambiguous in pursuit of our mission. We don\u2019t assume shared knowledge or beliefs across our team or our users, and we seek to understand others\u2019 \u201cwhy.\u201d When we don\u2019t agree with something, we assume positive intent & default to trust.\n\n**Build to last, iterate fast**\n\nWe see through the clouds of today into what\u2019s possible tomorrow. We don\u2019t fall prey to short-term thinking or get distracted by narratives and prices. We aim to move fast, learn from our mistakes, and we ship when it\u2019s right. Where our opinions bring safety, simplicity, and new choices in the best interest of our users, we express them. This long-term view is a big part of why we are a beloved brand. We must protect it.\n\n| How We Keep You Safe |\n| :---: |\n\n![][image2]",

In order to ensure that the usage of such electronics remains ethical and lawful, team members must abide by the following guidelines:\n\n* Uniswap Labs-issued laptops are only for work purposes to protect the security of Company information and your own privacy, in the event that Uniswap Labs needs to pull or monitor information on your work laptop.\n\n* To avoid phishing or malware emails, do not open e-mail messages from unknown senders or advertisers; rather, delete the emails or contact the People and Operations teams.\n\n* To prevent computer viruses from being transmitted through the system, team members are not authorized to download any software from the internet onto their computer or any drive in that computer unless authorized.\n\n* Use of portable drives to download Uniswap Labs information for any purpose other than Uniswap Labs business is prohibited without the advance written approval by the Uniswap Labs\u2019 management. \n\n* To protect against interception of Uniswap Labs\u2019s Confidential Information, please make sure that appropriate safeguards are used (e.g., encryption) for sensitive information.\n\n* Do not use Uniswap Labs\u2019 systems in a manner that could infringe on or violate the copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret or other proprietary rights of third parties.

Post this information in the channel.  \n* To support an inclusive work environment, please include your preferred pronouns on your profile. (e.g. \u201cJohn Doe \\-(they/them))  \n* Be mindful of the channels\u2019 member list before you start messaging. Keep conversations in both public and private channels work-appropriate.  \n* Take Slack conversations to email, phone, or face-to-face when required.  \n* Reserve @here, @channel, or @\\[name\\] for important or urgent matters only.  \n*  Update statuses accordingly and regularly, especially when away or OOO.  \n* Acknowledge receipt of messages and requests, even if you can\u2019t focus on the message or request until later.  \n*  Avoid sending multiple messages when you don\u2019t get an immediate response. Colleagues may be in meetings or doing \u201cdeep work\u201d.  \n* Be smart with your messages and share context and complete thoughts. For example, don\u2019t send a direct message that just says \u201chi\u201d to avoid unnecessary notifications and use threads to organize discussions.  \n* When an employee receives outreach from a third-party regarding Governance, the employee should assume the outreach is in their capacity as an employee and share information about the outreach internally on the \\#governance slack and note how the employee plans to respond to the outreach or to coordinate a response with others internally regarding the outreach, or on the \\#privileged-legal-sensitive, if there is a question about how these policies apply to a response.\n\nGoogle Meet (video) Policy  \nAt Uniswap Labs we use Google Meet to have video calls. \n\n Guidelines:\n\n* Google Meet is the preferred communication medium for meetings \u2013 even if meeting in person, please make sure there\u2019s a Google Meet link in the invite as some people may be unexpectedly remote.  \n* Ensure your camera and microphone are working before the start of each meeting. Turn your camera on unless it\u2019s not possible. This helps build engagement among colleagues and facilitates communication.  \n* In your display name, you may include your preferred pronouns.  \n* Mute your microphone when you are not an active participant to minimize background noise.  \n* Be mindful of the background visible in your Meets meeting. Limit distractions. While some distractions are unavoidable, try to limit distractions by turning off Slack notifications, putting your phone down etc.  \n* Avoid multitasking. You were invited to the meeting for a reason.",

One of our favorite ways to engage is through our social media platforms, and we have some guidance for how best to do that outlined below. \n\nUniswap Labs\u2019 Official Accounts  \nWe have official Uniswap Labs accounts on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/FCfyBSbCU5), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Uniswap), and [Github](https://github.com/Uniswap), all of which are easily found through our [website](https://uniswap.org/). Familiarize yourself with the Uniswap Labs brand and audiences; it is a great way to build relationships with consumers. We encourage you to follow  us on any and all of these platforms to stay up to date & informed. \n\nPersonal Social Media Accounts  \nShould you choose to engage in social media via your personal accounts, please use your best judgment when deciding what to post. Remember that an employee of Uniswap Labs, can be interpreted as representing the company. If you have something you want to post about the markets, your experience at work in the general sense, your thoughts on crypto, might be interpreted as coming by the Uniswap Labs team, please run it by the communications team before posting.\n\nGuidelines:\n\n* We expect that all Uniswap Labs team members will protect proprietary, confidential and copyrighted information, as well as refrain from posting derogatory content.  \n* Avoid using your social accounts to pump your bags \u2013 shilling tokens or projects for your own gain doesn\u2019t represent you or Uniswap Labs in an ethical or reputable way. If you are using applications that distribute tokens and are tied to Twitter or other social accounts, we encourage you to not include any affiliation to Uniswap.   \n* Be a crypto and web3 community evangelist \\- avoid spreading FUD or being a price puppeteer.   \n* Feel free to show your creativity or rep a favorite artist by using NFTs for your profile image.  \n* Consider the images and personal life details you share \\- drug usage, drug paraphernalia, discriminatory or hate speech, disrespectful statements and/or other similar content will be on the internet and follow you forever, and will be interpreted by some as a representation of the UL brand in a negative light. Some posts could also violate this policy so be smart about what you share.\n\nPotential clients and partners will want to get to know the organization and sometimes even team members; always present your best and true self. We will not continuously monitor your personal accounts, however all content you post should be done responsibly. We reserve the right to discipline team members in accordance with our policies for any content posted that is deemed inappropriate. \n\nWhen talking about the Protocol, you **must** follow these guidelines (on Social Media and/or informal settings):\n\n* Feel free to discuss the protocol generally: what it is, how it works, how it originated, what makes it unique, how it is better than any other protocol or AMM or the legacy financial system, etc.\n\n* Feel free to discuss the vibrant community, many integrations, and varied ecosystem contributions related to the Uniswap protocol. \n\nWays you **should not** talk about the Uniswap protocol, Uniswap Labs, or the UNI token (on Social Media and/or informal settings):\n\n* Do not use \u201cUniswap\u201d as a stand alone term or shorthand wherever possible. Always refer to \u201cUniswap Labs\u201d, the \u201cUniswap team\u201d, the \u201cUniswap protocol\u201d, \u201cUniswap interface\u201d, etc.  \n\n* Do not use \u201cwe\u201d to refer to the protocol (e.g., don\u2019t say \u201cwe do 1B in daily volume\u201d). If you are talking about the team or the interface, use \u201cUniswap Labs\u201d or \u201cUniswap interface\u201d. If you mean the protocol, say \u201cUniswap protocol\u201d. \n\n* Do not highlight the ability to do a token sale through the Uniswap protocol.\n\n* Do not mention the price of anything ever, expressly or implicitly. \n\n  * **Do not mention the UNI token price ever**\\--not even implicit references to increases (e.g., don\u2019t tweet \u201cWhat an amazing day\\!\u201d after UNI has a big jump). \n\n  * If you\u2019re ever asked about UNI, you can say Uniswap Labs does not speculate on the future price of UNI.\n\n  * Do not talk about the price of other tokens. The exception here is you can talk about the price of Bitcoin, ETH, or the very general token market (\u201cbull\u201d or \u201cbear\u201d etc.), as long as you\u2019re not using one of them as a proxy for UNI (e.g., don\u2019t say \u201cUNI is the biggest app on Ethereum and ETH is up today\u2026\u201d).\n\n  * You can talk about the price of Unisocks. Just don\u2019t suggest it might go up from the current price.\n\n* Do not encourage people to buy and sell cryptocurrency (e.g., \u201chodl\\!\u201d \u201cbuy the dip\\!\u201d).\n\n  * Avoid anything that could look like investment advice.\n\n* Generally do not publicly engage in conversations regarding the protocol fee switch that may accrue to UNI tokens.\n\n  * Do not say anything that might imply the price of UNI may go up, that we want it to go up, or are happy when it goes up. \n\n* Do not suggest that anyone should expect an airdrop. \n\n* Do not encourage anyone\u2019s expectations that people should rely on Uniswap Labs\u2019s efforts to make the protocol succeed and especially not to make the UNI token valuable. Highlight community efforts so people don\u2019t incorrectly get the impression that they should rely on us exclusively to drive any value to the UNI token.\n\n* Generally try not to reference competitors such as Pancakeswap or Sushiswap because it\u2019s free publicity for them.",

Full-time team members are eligible for all benefits, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of each benefit program.                                                                 \n\nPart-time team members are those regularly scheduled to work fewer than 30 hours per week and at least 20 hours per week. Part-time team members are not eligible for employee benefits, but may receive Uniswap Labs perks on an as-needed basis.\n\n**Fixed term** team members work for Uniswap Labs for a defined period of time to work on specific projects or tasks. These team members are eligible for our healthcare benefits if they are working full time hours.\n\nTemporary or Special-team members are hired for a specific period of employment (such as for a temporary replacement for an employee on a leave of absence or an internship), or for a special project. These temporary team members do not receive any of Uniswap Labs\u2019 benefits, other than those required to be provided by applicable law.\n\nNon-Employee Categories: Independent contractors, consultants, and agency service providers are not Uniswap Labs team members and are not eligible for any Uniswap Labs-sponsored employment benefits. You are an agency service provider if you perform services for Uniswap Labs through an independent contract service or agency, whether as a leased employee, contractor, temporary or similar designation.\n\nExempt: This term refers to those team members whose duties and responsibilities make them exempt from overtime compensation requirements, as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). If an Employee is classified as exempt, they do not receive compensation for overtime worked. If you have a question regarding whether you are exempt or nonexempt, contact your Manager for clarification.\n\nNon-Exempt \\- Overtime: By law, non-exempt team members may be compensated by equivalent time off for extra hours worked, provided the hours are scheduled and taken within the same pay period in which the work occurs. Overtime may not be worked without a Manager\u2019s approval. Non-Exempt team members are required to report all hours worked in a timekeeping system established by Uniswap Labs\u2019 timekeeping system. When overtime is paid, the Employee\u2019s wage rate increases to 1.5 times the normal hourly rate after 40 hours have been worked in a work week (defined as Sunday through Saturday). Additional overtime requirements may apply in certain states outside of New York (see below for California).\n\nTeam members who fail to obtain approval prior to working overtime should still record all overtime worked. Team members will be paid for all work performed. However, continually working unauthorized overtime in violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action.\n\nCalifornia team members\n\nIn California, nonexempt employees will be paid overtime as follows:\n\n* Compensation for hours in excess of 40 for the workweek, or in excess of eight and not more than 12 for the workday, and for the first eight hours on the seventh consecutive day of work in one workweek, shall be paid at a rate one and one-half times the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay; and  \n* Compensation for hours in excess of 12 in one workday and in excess of eight on the seventh consecutive workday in a workweek shall be paid at double the employee\u2019s regular rate of pay.",

We provide employment opportunities without regard to age, race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, disability (including gender dysphoria and similar gender-related conditions), sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation (including actual or perceived heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality, and asexuality), veteran status, military status, domestic violence victim status, reproductive health decision making or any other protected category\\*.  Both Uniswap Labs and the law prohibit unlawful employment discrimination. Unlawful discrimination occurs when an employer makes employment decisions, including hiring, promotion, raises, termination, and other terms and conditions of employment, based on the protected class of an applicant or employee, and not on merit. \n\nIn New York State and/or New York City, Protected Categories include traits historically associated with race (including but not limited to hair texture and protective hairstyles), creed, ancestry, alienage, familial or marital status, partnership status, caregiver status, gender, gender expression, the employee\u2019s or the employee\u2019s dependent\u2019s reproductive health decision making (including but not limited to a decision to use or access a particular drug, device or medical service), status as a victim of domestic violence, sex offenses or stalking, engaging in certain lawful off-duty and off-site legally protected recreational activities, and, in certain circumstances, unemployment status, credit history, salary history and arrest and conviction history.  All such discrimination is unlawful and against Uniswap Labs policy.  This policy applies to all aspects of employment, including, but not limited to, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, and termination, and it covers all individuals providing services in the workplace, including team members, interns, consultants, independent contractors, subcontractors, vendors and others providing services pursuant to a contract in the workplace (or team members of such persons).\n\n\\**classification protected by applicable state, federal, or local laws*     \nZero Tolerance Harassment Policy  \nBoth Uniswap Labs and the law also prohibit unlawful workplace harassment. Unlawful harassment is any conduct that creates an intimidating, offensive, or abusive working environment or subjects an individual to inferior terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. Harassment on the basis of any other protected class is also strictly prohibited. Prohibited harassment can take many forms, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n* Making or using derogatory comments, emails, letters, epithets, slurs, or explicit jokes.  \n* Derogatory posters, photographs, cartoons, drawings, websites, emails, text messages, or gestures.  \n* Touching, assaulting, impeding, or blocking normal movements.\n\nThis policy applies to all individuals providing services in the workplace and prohibits unlawful discrimination or harassment of or by team members, interns, consultants, independent contractors, subcontractors, vendors and others providing services pursuant to a contract in the workplace (or team members of such persons). In addition to this Policy, team members will be required to complete Harassment Prevention training on an annual basis.\n\nSexual harassment is a specific type of harassment involving either unwelcome sexual advances, or visual, verbal, or physical conduct based on sex, gender, pregnancy, or related stereotypes. Sexually harassing conduct can be between persons of the same or different genders.   \nSexual harassment also includes harassment that is not sexual in nature (for example, offensive remarks about an individual's sex or gender), as well as any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any other conduct of a sexual nature, when any of the following is true:\n\n* Submission to or rejection of the advance, request, or conduct is:  made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment; or used as a basis for employment decisions.  \n* The advances, requests, or conduct have the purpose or effect of substantially or unreasonably interfering with an employee's work performance by creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment, even if the complaining individual is not the intended target of the harassment.\n\nExamples of prohibited conduct include:\n\n* Verbal Sexual Harassment: Sexual innuendo, comments reflecting sex- or gender-based stereotypes, sexually suggestive comments, jokes of a sexual nature, sexual advances or propositions, offers of employment benefits in exchange for sexual favors, threatened or actual reprisals after a negative response to sexual advances, or graphic commentaries about a person\u2019s body.  \n* Written Sexual Harassment: Leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive objects or pictures, cartoons or posters, suggestive or insulting sounds, suggestive or obscene notes or letters or any social media platforms (both personal and work related).  \n* Physical Sexual Harassment: Physical contact of a sexual nature, including sexually suggestive or offensive touching, impeding, or blocking movements, fondling, kissing, massaging, or brushing up against the body.  \n* Online (for example, derogatory jokes or statements or sexually suggestive postings in any social media platform including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, etc.).\n\nThis list is illustrative only, and not exhaustive. Uniswap Labs prohibits all forms of sexual and discriminatory harassment at the workplace and at employer-sponsored events.\n\nWhere and When Harassment Can Occur  \nHarassment can occur not only at the workplace but at client meetings, business conferences, while traveling for business or at employer-sponsored parties and events.  Calls, texts, emails and social media usage by team members can constitute unlawful workplace harassment, even if they occur away from the workplace premises, on personal devices or during non-work hours.  \n\nComplaint Procedure  \nIf you have been subjected to or witness any behavior that may constitute sexual or other harassment, discrimination or any other violation of this policy, you are encouraged to promptly speak to, write, email, or otherwise contact your Manager, a member of the People Operations team, or any other member of senior management with whom you feel comfortable.    \n\t  \nComplaints or reports may be made verbally or in writing.  To submit a written complaint, individuals are encouraged to use the [Complaint Form](#harassment-complaint-form), which is available at the end of this Handbook.  Individuals who are reporting a complaint on behalf of other individuals should use the Complaint Form and note that it is on another person\u2019s behalf.  The complaint should be as detailed as possible, including the names of all individuals involved and any witnesses. \n\nThe effectiveness of Uniswap Labs\u2019 efforts depends largely on individuals telling us about inappropriate workplace conduct.  If individuals feel that they or someone else may have been subjected to conduct that violates this policy, it should be reported immediately.  If individuals do not report sexually harassing or other harassing conduct, Uniswap Labs may not become aware of a possible violation of this policy and may not be able to take appropriate corrective action.  \n\nInvestigation by Uniswap Labs  \nUniswap Labs takes all complaints of sexual and other discriminatory harassment seriously and will promptly and thoroughly investigate the facts and circumstances of all complaints, whether the complaint was made verbally or in writing.  Any employee may be required to cooperate as needed in an investigation of suspected sexual or other harassment. \n\nWhile the investigation process may vary from case to case, Uniswap Labs\u2019 investigation may involve one or more of the following:  interviewing the complaining party and the individual about whom the complaint was made;  taking any interim actions as appropriate;  obtaining, reviewing and preserving relevant documents, including electronic communications; interviewing any relevant witnesses;  and documenting the investigation. Uniswap Labs will promptly notify the complaining party and the individual about whom the complaint was made of the completion of the investigation and, as appropriate, of the final determination. Uniswap Labs will take prompt corrective action as appropriate to eliminate sexual and other harassment, including disciplinary measures up to and including termination of employment.\n\nAll persons involved, including complainants, witnesses, and alleged harassers, will be accorded due process to protect their rights to a fair and impartial investigation.  The investigation will be kept confidential to the greatest extent possible, consistent with conducting a thorough and fair investigation.  \n\nAlternative Reporting and Remedies   \nUniswap Labs encourages individuals to report incidents of harassment and any other violation of this policy internally. However, individuals who believe they have been subjected to sexual or other harassment or discrimination in the workplace also may seek relief by:   \n \n\n* Filing a \"Charge of Discrimination\" with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for violation of federal anti-discrimination laws, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII).  You can contact the EEOC by calling 1-800-669-4000 (TTY: 1-800-669-6820), visiting their website at [http://www.eeoc.gov](http://www.eeoc.gov), or by email at info@eeoc.gov.  \n    \n* Team members working in New York State may file a complaint alleging violation of the New York State Human Rights Law, either with the New York State Division of Human Rights (NYSDHR) or in New York State Supreme Court. NYSDHR's main office contact information is:  NYS Division of Human Rights, One Fordham Plaza, Fourth Floor, Bronx, New York 10458\\. You can also call (718) 741-8400 or visit: [http://www.dhr.ny.gov](http://www.dhr.ny.gov).   \n    \n* Team members working in New York City may file complaints alleging violation of the New York City Human Rights Law with the New York City Commission on Human Rights (NYCCHR) or in New York State Supreme Court.  NYCCHR\u2019s main office contact information is:  Law Enforcement Bureau of the NYC Commission on Human Rights, 40 Rector Street, 10th Floor, New York, New York; you can also call 311 or (212) 306-7450 or visit [www.nyc.gov/html/cchr/html/home/home.shtml](http://www.nyc.gov/html/cchr/html/home/home.shtml).\n\n\nOther states and local jurisdictions may have additional protections against sexual and other harassment and discrimination.  team members can contact the state, county, city or town in which they live to find out if such a law exists.  \n\nUnder the applicable employment discrimination laws, there are different deadlines for filing complaints with the different government agencies and courts.  If unlawful harassment is found to have occurred, government agencies and courts may be able to provide various remedies, such as requiring an employer to take appropriate action to stop the harassment and awarding monetary damages and attorney\u2019s fees.\n\nNo Retaliation  \nRetaliation against or harassment of individuals who oppose any unlawful practice under the employment discrimination laws, in good faith file complaints, or truthfully assist or participate in an investigation or proceeding involving sexual or other harassment or discrimination, is unlawful and prohibited by Uniswap Labs.  No one will be subject to any form of discipline, reprisal, intimidation, harassment or retaliation for good faith reporting or complaints of incidents of harassment, discrimination or any other violation of this policy or the law, or for pursuing any harassment or discrimination claim, assisting another individual to report harassment or discrimination, or testifying or cooperating in related investigations or other proceedings.  Any such retaliation or harassment should be reported, and team members found to be engaging in such unlawful conduct will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\n\nResponsibilities of Managers  \nAll managers who receive a complaint or information about suspected sexual or other discriminatory harassment, observe what may be harassing behavior, or for any reason suspect that there may be harassment or any other violation of this policy, are required to report such suspected harassment or violation to a member of the People team.\n\nIn addition to being subject to discipline if they engaged in sexually harassing conduct or other harassing conduct themselves, managers will be subject to discipline for failing to report suspected sexual harassment or other discriminatory harassment, or otherwise knowingly allowing sexual harassment or other harassment to continue.\n\nManagers will also be subject to discipline for engaging in any retaliation.",

We comply with the *Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)*, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, and all other state and local fair employment practices and laws. As an Equal Opportunity employer, it is important to us that our team members feel valued and supported. Therefore, it is our policy not to discriminate against any qualified individual with disabilities in any process (application, hiring, compensation, training, etc.). We also provide reasonable accommodations to our team members related to pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions. \n\nUniswap Labs will engage in an interactive process with an applicant or employee to identify and explore possible reasonable accommodations for the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of the job, unless undue hardship would result. We may require medical certification of both the disability and the need for accommodation.  Keep in mind that Uniswap Labs can only seek to accommodate the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified disabled individual. Therefore, it is your responsibility to come forward if you are in need of an accommodation.  \n\nUniswap Labs will also engage in an interactive process, as outlined below, to explore and provide reasonable accommodations for other needs that would allow the employee to perform the essential functions of the job without creating an undue hardship for Uniswap Labs, including for needs related to the following:\n\n* Pregnancy, childbirth or a related medical condition, which may include bathroom breaks, breaks to facilitate increased water intake, periodic rest (for team members who stand for prolonged periods), and/or an unpaid leave of absence.\n\n\n* Domestic violence, sex offenses or stalking, a leave to seek medical attention or psychological counseling for the employee or the employee\u2019s child; obtain services from a domestic violence shelter, program or rape crisis center; participate in safety planning, including relocation; or attend to legal matters.\n\n\n* A sincerely held religious belief, practice or observance, which may include adjustments to work schedules or modifications to certain workplace policies.  \n\nIf you would like to make an accommodation request, please ask your manager or your People Business Partner.

Team members may request the use of our Lactation Room by contacting a member of the People Team, and we will direct you to it.  If two or more individuals need to use the Lactation Room at the same time, Uniswap Labs will provide a procedure to follow so that the needs of all those who need to use the Lactation Room can be reasonably accommodated.

However, if an employee cannot give 30 days\u2019 advance notice due to the need to use PDL being unforeseeable, the employee must provide as much notice as is practicable.\n\nOther Non-Leave Rights Related to Pregnancy Disability  \nAn eligible employee who experiences a qualifying event may request a reasonable accommodation, including transfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position (where one is available) or duties if it is medically advisable because of pregnancy-related disability.  The notice requirement described above applies equally to these non-leave rights.  An employee who takes PDL or is granted a transfer as a reasonable accommodation normally will be able to return to the same or comparable position with the same status, pay, length of service credit and seniority as on the date that the leave or reasonable accommodation commenced.\n\nDocumentation  \nThe employee must provide Uniswap Labs with a certification from a health care provider verifying the need for PDL. The certification should contain:\n\n* The date on which the employee became disabled due to pregnancy;  \n* The probable duration of the period or periods of disability; and  \n* A statement that, due to the disability, the employee is unable to perform one or more of the essential functions of her position without undue risk to herself, the successful completion of her pregnancy, or to other persons.\n\n| How We Work  |\n| :---: |\n\n![][image2]",

The purpose of the NY HERO Act is to protect employees against exposure and disease during a future airborne infectious disease outbreak. \n\nUnder this law, the New York State Department of Labor (NYS DOL), in consultation with the NYS Department of Health, has developed an Airborne Infectious Disease Exposure Prevention Standard, a Model Airborne Infectious Disease Exposure Prevention Plan, and various industry-specific model plans for the prevention of airborne infectious disease. Employers can choose to adopt the applicable policy template/plan provided by NYS DOL or establish an alternative plan that meets or exceeds the standard\u2019s minimum requirements.\n\nThe airborne infectious disease exposure prevention plans must go into effect when an airborne infectious disease is designated by the New York State Commissioner of Health as a highly contagious communicable disease that presents a serious risk of harm to the public health. When designated, employers are required to provide a copy of the adopted airborne infectious disease exposure prevention plan and post the same in a visible and prominent location within each worksite. Templates and resources are available below. \n\nOn March 17, 2022, the designation of COVID-19 as an airborne infectious disease that presents a serious risk of harm to the public health under the HERO Act ended.

We know that our team members do best when they feel supported outside of the workplace, so we want to ensure that we do our best to help make your transition into parenthood a joyous one\\!\n\nThe Uniswap Parental Leave Policy is a paid leave benefit provided to Eligible team members (as defined below) who are unable to work due to pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions and/or who wish to take time off from work to bond with a new child. Birthing mothers will be entitled to up to 16 weeks (4 months) with all other parents entitled up to 12 weeks (3 months). \n\nRegular full-time team members are eligible for this policy on their first day of employment. Other team members (i.e., temporary team members and part-time team members) are not entitled to leave or benefits under this policy but are provided with leave, pay and accommodations in accordance with Uniswap Labs\u2019 other policies and all applicable laws. \n\nQualifying Leave  \nUniswap Parental Leave commences upon the birth of a child or upon the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care and must be used concurrently with any other leave or benefits for which the employee is eligible (e.g., short-term disability leave or state paid family leave benefits) within 12 months of the child\u2019s birth or placement. This includes any period of disability occasioned by an employee\u2019s inability to perform the essential functions of her job, with or without a reasonable accommodation, due to pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, and any period of leave taken by an employee to bond with a new child, including foster and adoptive children. Please note that other leave and benefits may be available to team members before or after the Uniswap Parental Leave period.  \n\nPay and Benefits; Increments of Use  \nDuring the Uniswap Parental Leave period, subject to fulfilling all requirements, team members will receive their regular base pay (which may be paid in part by short term disability or paid family leave benefits), and Uniswap Labs will continue to provide group health benefits (and team members will be required to continue making any required contributions) on the same terms as if the employee had not taken leave. Uniswap Parental Leave may be taken on an intermittent (non-consecutive) basis with the approval of the employee\u2019s manager and a member of the People Operations team, or to the extent an employee is entitled to intermittent leave under applicable law. An intermittent leave will require a detailed plan of when the team member will be on leave vs working and include the desired length of each part of the leave used. The People Team and the employees manager will review and approve.\n\nConcurrent Leave and Benefits  \nUniswap Parental Leave runs concurrently with (and includes) any other leave or benefits for which the employee may be eligible under federal or state laws or other Uniswap Labs benefits, including without limitation short-term disability leave and state paid family leave benefits, to the extent permitted by such plans and policies.  The pay benefits provided by Uniswap Labs under this policy will supplement any pay benefits to which the employee may be entitled, and in no case will pay from all sources exceed 100% of the employee\u2019s regular base salary.  \n\nHow to Apply for Leave  \nWhen the need for leave is foreseeable, team members should give at least 30 days\u2019 notice of the request for leave. If 30 days\u2019 notice is not possible due to medical necessity or for other reasons, you should provide as much notice as possible. team members will be required to apply for all benefits and leaves for which they are eligible (such as short-term disability or paid family leave benefits).  Please speak to the People Team for details.\n\nReasonable Accommodation  \nAll team members, including those who are not eligible for Uniswap Parental Leave, who need reasonable accommodation (which may include leave) for pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, refer to the [Reasonable Accommodations](#reasonable-accommodations:-disability,-nursing-mothers-and-religious) section.\n\nReturn to Work  \nDuring Uniswap Parental Leave, your job will be held for you in accordance with applicable law.  Please note that team members have no greater right to reinstatement under this policy than if they had been continuously employed rather than on leave.    \nNothing in this policy affects your status as an at-will employee. Uniswap Labs prohibits discrimination or retaliation against any employee for taking Uniswap Parental Leave.  If you have any questions, please speak to a member of the People Ops team.\n\nOur parental leave policy complements, and will not contradict the [New York State Paid Family Leave (NYPFL)](https://paidfamilyleave.ny.gov/) and the [Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla). If you need further clarification on these policies, consult our People Ops Leader and/or either of the policies mentioned in this handbook.\n\nPaid Family Leave  \nThis particular policy applies only to team members working in New York State, as this benefit is administered by the state and paid for by payroll deductions from New York team members.  team members working in certain states outside of New York may be eligible for similar-type benefits *IF* their state has such a benefit. Please speak to the People Ops team to inquire if such a benefit is available in your state.  \n\nNew York Paid Family Leave  \nUnder the New York Paid Family Leave Benefits Law (\u201cPFL\u201d), team members in New York State may be eligible to take partially paid leave from work for the following:\n\n* To bond with a new child within 12 months of the child\u2019s birth or placement with the employee for adoption or foster care.    \n* To provide care, including physical or psychological care, for the employee\u2019s family member with a serious health condition.  \n* To attend to \u201cqualifying exigencies\u201d as defined under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act, arising out of the fact that the employee\u2019s spouse, domestic partner, child or parent in the US military is on covered active duty abroad or is called to active duty abroad.\n\nPFL benefits are generally not available for an employee\u2019s own serious health condition (except for certain limited situations for certain team members when the employee is under an order of quarantine or isolation due to COVID-19).  For purposes of this policy, the following definitions apply:\n\n* \u201cFamily member\u201d means an employee\u2019s parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, spouse or domestic partner. Beginning on January 1, 2023, \u201cfamily member\u201d will also include siblings.  \n* \u201cSerious health condition\u201d means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves (i) inpatient care in a hospital, hospice or residential health care facility, or (ii) continuing treatment or continuing supervision by a health care provider, including but not limited to preparation for and recovery from surgery related to organ or tissue donation.    \n* \u201cQualifying exigency\u201d has the meaning as it is defined under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act and includes, for example, attending to child care or parental care arrangements, financial and legal arrangements, counseling, military events, post-deployment events, and spending time with a covered military family member on short-term Rest and Recuperation leave.\n\nDuration of Leave and Increments of Use  \nThe PFL law provides for up to 12 weeks of leave in a 52-week period. The 52-week period is a \u201crolling\u201d 52-week period measured backward with respect to each day for which PFL benefits are claimed. Leave may be taken on an intermittent basis in increments of one full day (or one fifth of the weekly benefit).\n\nEligibility and Payroll Deductions  \nTeam members who work 20 or more hours per week are eligible after completing 26 consecutive weeks of employment. Team members who work less than 20 hours per week are eligible after 175 days of employment. PFL benefits are financed through payroll deductions, which may begin prior to the commencement of coverage, in accordance with New York State law. Team members whose work schedules will not allow the employee to become eligible for PFL coverage will be offered the option to be exempted from payroll deductions for PFL coverage and waive PFL benefits by completing [this form](http://docs.paidfamilyleave.ny.gov/content/main/forms/PFLDocs/PFLWaiver.pdf) and providing it to a member of the People Ops team.  \n\nPay and Benefits During PFL  \nDuring PFL, team members receive a certain percentage of their average weekly wage, up to a cap of the New York State Average Weekly Wage (\u201cNYSAWW\u201d).  For leave commencing effective January 1, 2021, eligible team members will receive 67% of their average weekly wage, up to a cap of 67% of the NYSAWW.  During the leave, Uniswap Labs will maintain an employee\u2019s group health insurance coverage on the same terms as if the employee had not taken leave, and the employee will be required to continue making contributions on the same terms as if he or she had not taken leave.  \n\nHow to Apply for PFL  \nIf the need for leave is foreseeable, team members must give Uniswap Labs at least 30 days\u2019 written notice before the date that the leave is expected to begin, or, if not foreseeable, as soon as practicable.  Failure to provide timely notice may result in a delay or partial denial of benefits.  An employee who seeks to use PFL will be required to submit a claim form to Guardian (through Sequoia), the Uniswap Labs\u2019s PFL insurance carrier, along with documentation supporting their need for leave (e.g., birth certificate, medical certification or military deployment papers).  Please contact a member of the People Ops team for the required forms.  Forms are also available from the Uniswap Labs\u2019s PFL insurance carrier and from the New York State website [here](http://www.ny.gov/new-york-state-paid-family-leave/paid-family-leave-forms-team%20members-employers-and-insurance-carriers). \n\nUpon an employee\u2019s return from PFL, to the full extent required by law Uniswap Labs will reinstate the employee to the employee\u2019s original position or, if no longer available, to an equivalent position with equivalent terms and conditions of employment, including pay and employment benefits, in accordance with applicable law; provided that an employee returning from PFL has no greater right to reinstatement than if the employee had been continuously employed.  Retaliation against an employee who requests or takes PFL is strictly prohibited.  \n\nCoordination of PFL with Other Leaves  \nTo the extent that an employee\u2019s leave qualifies for both PFL and any other leave(s), PFL will run concurrently with all other leaves, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and policies.  To the extent that team members are eligible for both short-term disability benefits and PFL benefits during the same period, team members may not concurrently receive both benefits (except in certain limited situations related to COVID-19).  An employee\u2019s combined short-term disability benefits and PFL benefits may not exceed 26 weeks in the same 52-week period.    \nPTO may not be used concurrently to supplement PFL benefits.\n\nCalifornia Family Right Acts Leave  \nThis policy is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of the California Family Rights Act (\u201cCFRA\u201d) provisions governing parental leave.  \n\nEligibility  \nA California-based employee is eligible for a leave under this policy if he or she (i) has worked for Uniswap Labs for at least 12 months prior to the date on which the leave is to commence; and (ii) has worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period preceding the leave.  \n\nLeave Entitlement  \nCFRA leave may be up to 12 workweeks in a 12-month period, within any 12-month rolling period, for any of the following reasons:\n\n* The birth, adoption, or foster care placement of your child.  \n* To care for your own serious health condition.  \n* To care for the serious health condition of your child, spouse, domestic partner, parent, including parent-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling.  \n* a qualifying exigency related to the covered active duty or call to covered active duty of an employee's spouse, domestic partner, child, or parent, including parent-in-law in the US Armed Forces. \n\nNotice  \nAn employee must provide at least 30 days\u2019 advance notice of departure.  However, if an employee cannot give 30 days\u2019 advance notice due to circumstances beyond his or her control, the employee may provide less notice as long as the employee provides as much notice as is practicable.\n\nReturning to Work  \nUpon an employee\u2019s return from PFL, Uniswap Labs will reinstate the employee to his or her original position or, if no longer available, to an equivalent position with equivalent terms and conditions of employment, including pay and employment benefits, in accordance with applicable law. Use of PFL cannot result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued before the start of PFL that was not used during the leave.\n\nNon-Retaliation & Additional Information  \nThe Uniswap Labs prohibits discrimination or retaliation against an employee who requests or takes leave under this policy.  For additional information about PFL leave, please contact the People Ops team.",

Any Uniswap Labs reference to controlled substances in this policy or otherwise shall include marijuana, including physician-prescribed marijuana, unless otherwise stated.    \nWith one exception as described below, the following are strictly prohibited by Uniswap Labs:\n\n1. The possession or use, or being under the influence of, alcohol, illegal drugs, or a controlled substance while on the job, unless the use of the controlled substance is consistent with a physician\u2019s prescription that is lawful under federal and state law and does not impair the employee\u2019s ability to work satisfactorily or pose a risk to workplace safety.\n\n2. Driving a Uniswap Labs-provided vehicle (whether or not the employee is working) or driving on business (whether or not in a Uniswap Labs-provided vehicle) while under the influence of alcohol, illegal drugs, or a controlled substance; and\n\n3.

This prohibition includes payments to third parties where you know, or have reason to know, that the third party will use any part of the payment for bribes or other corrupt payments.\n\nUnless permitted by this Policy or by written approval from the Legal Team, no offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization to pay or provide any money, gifts, entertainment, travel, or anything else of value will be made, solicited, or accepted, by or on behalf of the Company, to or from any person, including any Foreign Official.  These prohibitions apply to payments or offers to pay or give anything of value, whether or not they involve the use of corporate resources (*e.g.*, personal expenditure or entertainment).\n\n### (b)       \t*Cash Payments*\n\nCash payments of any kind to a third party, other than documented petty cash disbursements or other valid and approved payments, are prohibited.  Company checks shall not be written to \u201ccash,\u201d \u201cbearer,\u201d or anyone other than the party entitled to payment, except to replenish properly used petty cash funds.\n\n### (c)        \t*Hospitality*\n\nThe FCPA permits certain payments for reasonable and bona fide expenses that are *directly related* to the promotion, demonstration, or explanation of the Company\u2019s products and services.  As such, the Company abides by the following practices:\n\n* Any travel or entertainment expenses must be limited solely to those individuals necessary for the furtherance of the Company\u2019s business.  No payments can be authorized for travel or entertainment expenses for spouses or guests.  \n* All travel and entertainment expenses must be accurately and adequately documented in the books and records of the Company, including the purpose or value of these expenses.  \n* Legitimate gifts, meals, and entertainment are permitted only if they are of nominal value, infrequent, and not offered for an improper purpose.  Prior approval from the Legal Team is required for all gifts, meals, and entertainment with a value of greater than $50.\n\nAny proposed provision of travel or lodging must be described in writing to the Legal Team, who alone has the authority to approve the request.\n\n### (d)       \t*Facilitation Payments*\n\nThe Company prohibits \u201cfacilitation payments\u201d (*i.e.*, small payments to facilitate routine, non-discretionary government functions), which are illegal under the anti-corruption laws of many other countries.\n\n### (e)        \t*Political and Charitable Contributions*\n\nUnless permitted by written approval from the Legal Team, no money, assets, property, or other thing of value of the Company may be contributed, loaned, or made available to any candidate, party, or political committee.\n\nUnder no circumstances may charitable contributions be made at the suggestion, request, or at the behest of any Foreign Official to obtain any improper advantage or to a charity owned, controlled, or connected to a Foreign Official.\n\n### (f)         \t*Books, Records, and Accounting*\n\nThe Company maintains books and accounting records that accurately reflect all transactions in reasonable detail.  These recordkeeping requirements apply to all payments (including the types described above), not merely those that would be material in the traditional financial sense.\n\nOfficers, directors, employees, contractors, and third parties are prohibited from manipulating books or records in an effort to mask transactions, either by characterizing them in some oblique way or by omitting them from the Company\u2019s books or records entirely.  Accordingly, no undisclosed or unrecorded accounts may be maintained for any purpose.\n\n### (g)        \t*Relationships with Agents and Other Third Parties*\n\nThe Company strictly prohibits using an agent, consultant, intermediary, or other third party acting on the Company\u2019s behalf to make a payment or gift that would be prohibited by our Policy if made by the Company or its employees.  The actions of third parties present particular risks because, in certain circumstances, the Company and its employees can be held liable for improper payments made by a third party, even if the Company did not have actual knowledge of the payment.      \n\n# 5\\.          \tAnti-Money Laundering (AML) Laws\n\nMoney laundering is the process by which those involved in criminal activities conceal the source of and disguise the nature of illicit funds by making them appear legitimate.  The Company is not a financial institution required under AML Laws to maintain a formal anti-money laundering policy.  But because participating in or facilitating a financial transaction that involves the proceeds of illegal activity may constitute a money laundering crime, the Company\u2019s policy is not to facilitate money laundering.  Although the Company does not conduct any special diligence to determine the source fund of its investors or other counterparties, the Company reserves the right to refuse to do business with any person, including as a vendor or person providing financing to or an investment in the Company, if the Company believes that such person presents a money laundering risk.

    "chunk_heading": "OFAC Sanctions and Trade Compliance Program",
    "text": "## OFAC Sanctions and Trade Compliance Program \n\nOFAC administers and enforces U.S. economic and trade sanctions programs against specific comprehensively sanctioned jurisdictions (listed above), as well as targeted foreign governments, individuals, groups, economic sectors, and entities around the world in accordance with national security and foreign policy goals and objectives. While many of the listed prohibited parties are concentrated in jurisdictions of known concern to the U.S. Government (such as Russia, Belarus, China, and Venezuela), there are some parties resident in almost all countries in the world who appear on the \u201cblacklist\u201d (formally the \u201cSpecially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List\u201d or the \u201cSDN List\u201d), which is managed and principally enforced by OFAC.  \n   \nOFAC has an important law enforcement and national security function working to leverage and protect U.S. global power through its work on counter-terrorism, anti-money laundering, and sanctions. OFAC and the broader Treasury Department \u2013 including its sister agency, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Center (FinCEN) \u2013 closely scrutinize new technologies or entities that could threaten American national security through failure to comply with its regulations. Similarly, potential partners or mainstream investors in Uniswap will avoid the company if we do not have a Sanctions and Trade Compliance Program (STCP) to appropriately address our compliance risk profile.\n\n   \nFinally, in addition to corporate regulatory risk, our employees face personal risk if they are found to facilitate financing for terrorists or rogue regimes or otherwise act in violation of OFAC regulations. Entities and individuals who the U.S. Government deems to have violated these regulations \u2013 by impermissibly undertaking or facilitating transactions with blocked entities or jurisdictions \u2013 face significant civil and criminal liabilities, including the potential for substantial fines and, if violations are deemed serious enough, even incarceration. Importantly, individuals and companies can face civil consequences (fines) under a strict liability theory \u2013 violative actions do not need to be significant *nor purposeful* in order to be subjected to regulatory consequences.\n\n   \nOFAC expects companies involved with digital assets, such as Uniswap, to adopt a \u201crisk-based\u201d approach to compliance. See [OFAC Sanctions Compliance Guidance for the Virtual Currency Industry](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/virtual_currency_guidance_brochure.pdf).  As such, our approach to compliance should take into account our business model, as well as what we understand to be the fast-changing regulatory environment.  \n   \nOFAC\u2019s \u201crisk-based\u201d expectation means that there is no one-size-fits all approach to complying with the agency\u2019s regulations (and related FinCEN regulations and export restrictions administered by the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)). Rather, OFAC encourages an organization subject to U.S. jurisdiction, such as Uniswap, to employ a \u201crisk-based approach to sanctions compliance\u201d by developing, implementing, and routinely updating its STCP. According to OFAC\u2019s Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), a risk-based approach for compliance in the cryptocurrency arena is similar to one for fiat currency. Indeed, OFAC\u2019s limited guidance on cryptocurrency suggests that the obligations for entities dealing with cryptocurrency are identical to those dealing with fiat currency. In fact, OFAC jurisdiction is not triggered by the exchange of currency \u2013 but rather by the undertaking of any dealing in which anything of value (including a service) is provided to, by, or through a counterparty. Generally, if a counterparty is restricted (due to their location in a comprehensively sanctioned jurisdiction or presence on the SDN List), any undertaking with it is prohibited regardless the means, mechanism or denomination of the exchange. If there is a violation, OFAC will consider as an important mitigation in its assessment of appropriate enforcement actions if an alleged violator had an appropriate STCP at the time of the apparent violation. Uniswap therefore analyzes the risks of sanctions violations below and has tailored its sanctions compliance program in keeping with those risks and OFAC\u2019s approach to enforcement.  \n   \nBecause Uniswap deals with novel financial products on which OFAC and other agencies have been concentrating, our risks are somewhat elevated (compared with an offline enterprise for example). According to [OFAC guidance](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/framework_ofac_cc.pdf) released in May 2019, companies should consider the risks of \u201cusing the U.S. financial system\u201d or \u201cprocessing payments\u201d for OFAC-sanctioned entities, individuals and jurisdictions. While Uniswap is not formally part of the traditional financial system nor does it *generally* process payments, it does permit the exchange of value between parties unrelated to Uniswap. Consequently, that is the key risk that needs to be addressed and managed via the STCP.  \n   \nUniswap\u2019s risk across the Protocol, the Token, and the Interface differ and consequently the STCP provides that appropriate risk-based compliance is also different across these products.  \n   \n1\\. \tOn the Protocol, we should be willing to provide proactive education to law enforcement and policy makers and to direct such law enforcement and policy makers to blockchain analytics consultants and experts or engage a consultant directly to help with reactive technical diligence.  \n   \n2\\. \tOn the Token, when we are involved in token transactions, such as directly paying someone in tokens, Uniswap should engage in appropriate risk-based measures including, as necessary, adhering to the Uniswap Policy on Compliance with Anti-Corruption and Anti-Money Laundering Laws.  \n   \n3\\. \tOn the Interface we should:  \na. geo-block all jurisdictions subject to comprehensive sanctions.  \nb. block all Ethereum addresses on the SDN List and file necessary reports to OFAC  if these addresses attempt to trade on the Interface.  \nc. continue to work with TRM Labs or others in the industry, to be able to respond to suspicious behavior identified on the Interface.  \n   \nAs noted, the Protocol, the Token, and Interface differ and different risk-based compliance is called for each offering. (One commonality between them is that none involves the sort of encryption requiring notice to the government authorities like the National Security Agency and BIS\u2014there\u2019s no encryption in the token or smart contract, as all the encryption is published in Ethereum.)  \n   \n**Protocol Compliance**  \nWith respect to the Protocol, it is \u201cpublicly available\u201d much like Linux and therefore our obligations are very limited. By definition, such software is \u201cavailable for download \\[or use\\] without restriction.\u201d The Protocol is an immutable code and we cannot block transactions or approve them. The relationship between Uniswap (or Universal Navigation, Inc.) and the Uniswap Protocol is similar to the relationships between (a) Vint Cerf and the Internet Protocol; (b) Tim Berners-Lee and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol; (c) Satoshi Nakamoto and the Bitcoin Protocol; (d) the Ethereum Foundation and the Ethereum protocol. As a general matter, none of these \u201cinventors\u201d control who uses the products they developed nor for what purpose. As a general matter, none of them is responsible for sanctions violations using their protocols. This remains true even though Bitcoin and Ethereum, like Uniswap, are financial protocols for transferring value. It remains the case even though both Satoshi and the Ethereum Foundation received compensation through retaining or early mining of protocol tokens.  \n   \nEven if our risk-based compliance obligations are limited with respect to the Protocol, we should be willing to proactively provide authorities with educational conversations and materials so that we can emphasize our commitment to compliance with the authorities and they, in turn, can gain a greater understanding of our operations and be able to address actors who are not taking their OFAC responsibilities seriously (including by providing Uniswap guidance, as needed, concerning appropriate compliance).\n\n   \nAt the same time, even if the mechanics of our appropriately risk-based compliance obligations with respect to the Interface are limited, they exist and compliance with OFAC regulations remains critical. The Interface may be analogous to a simple website, but websites have compliance obligations. Vint Cerf works for Google; Google\u2019s website complies with OFAC. Satoshi, as a non-U.S. person located outside of the United States, may not have co-direct compliance obligations with OFAC, but Coinbase, as a U.S. person, does. Open sourcing the Interface code does not change this requirement; WordPress is open source and websites using it must comply with OFAC. The IPFS/IPNS hosting does not change this calculus either, especially in light of our updating the codebase regularly and the pinning service. Indeed, such updating and pinning provides enough of a U.S. nexus that OFAC compliance obligations likely attach.  \n   \n**Token Compliance**  \nRegarding the Token, when we are involved in Token transactions, such as directly paying someone in tokens, we must engage in appropriate risk-based measures including, as necessary, AML/KYC (including OFAC).  \n   \n**Interface Compliance**  \nInterface compliance requires geo-blocking comprehensively sanctioned jurisdictions. If we do not block traders located in Iran on the Interface, for example, we could be seen as \u201cfacilitating\u201d prohibited transactions or impermissibly exporting financial services to Iran. As of the date of this message, sanctioned jurisdictions are listed above in TL;DR. We must block access to any IP address in those jurisdictions. We have asked Cloudflare to block these regions. Cloudflare can discard the IP addresses after screening. (OFAC recognizes that users can employ VPNs and that geo-blocking is imperfect; however, perfection  is not the goal. Risk-based compliance measures are the key and geo-blocking is considered an industry standard and best practice). We utilize TRM Labs for assistance in blocking comprehensively sanctioned regions (rather than countries), such as Crimea. The Crimea sanctions have been in place for more than five years and as such there is significant best practices in the market as to how to appropriately geo-block the region.  Currently TRM is also actively investigating and monitoring the Russia-Ukraine conflict and its impact on sanctions. TRM tracks Russian extremist groups, for instance, with links to the DNR region and is collaborating with Ukrainian authorities to surface links between blockchain addresses and sanctioned persons, entities, and countries.  \n   \nUniswap should block transactions involving any Ethereum addresses on the SDN List or otherwise connected to SDNs. These addresses are associated with sanctioned people. As of January 11, 2023, OFAC maintained 142 ETH addresses (2x duplicate addresses identified).  We should block them on the Uniswap Interface \u2013 and to the extent any party tries to transact with these addresses, the payment transfer must be blocked and reported to OFAC within 10 business days of the attempted transaction.\n\n   \nWe use TRM Wallet Screening to screen addresses that connect to the Interface in order to detect ownership and counterparty risk exposure related to sanctioned addresses and entities. When any address connects to the Interface, we send that address to TRM\u2019s API and TRM screens it based on a risk engine configured by Uniswap. TRM links addresses to sanctioned persons, sanctioned organizations, and entities in sanctioned jurisdictions.  The Trade Compliance Group or a law firm then uses the TRM data to assess the risks of identified addresses.  \n   \nTRM Labs checks for updates daily and helps ensure our blocking list is current.",
